Rating: 8.1
Plot: La Haine opens with a montage of news footage depicting urban riots in a banlieue in the commune of Chanteloup-les-Vignes near Paris. In the aftermath of the riots, a local man named Abdel Ichaha is gravely injured in police custody and is in intensive care. The riots escalate, leading to a siege of the local police station and the loss of a police officer's revolver. The film follows the lives of three friends of Abdel, who are all young men from immigrant families, over approximately twenty consecutive hours.
Vinz, a young Jewish man with an aggressive temperament, seeks revenge for Abdel's condition. He harbors a deep hatred for all police officers and secretly emulates Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver in front of his bathroom mirror. Hubert, an Afro-French boxer and small-time drug dealer, aspires to escape the banlieue and create a better life for himself. However, his boxing gymnasium was destroyed in the riots. Saïd, a young North African Muslim, acts as a mediator between Vinz and Hubert.
The three friends lead a directionless daily routine and frequently find themselves under police surveillance. After a rooftop gathering which is broken up by the police, Vinz reveals that he has discovered the .44 Magnum revolver lost during the riot. He plans to use it to kill a police officer if Abdel dies. While Hubert disapproves, Vinz secretly takes the gun with him. They visit Abdel in the hospital but are turned away by the police. Saïd is arrested after they aggressively refuse to leave, but he is later released with the assistance of a familiar police officer.
A disagreement arises between Vinz and Hubert regarding their perspectives on policing and violence, leading them to part ways temporarily. Saïd accompanies Vinz, while Hubert briefly returns home. They reunite at another gathering in the banlieue, which quickly descends into chaos when Abdel's brother attempts to murder a police officer as an act of revenge. This triggers a confrontation with the police, and the group narrowly escapes after Vinz almost shoots a riot officer. They board a train to Paris, where their interactions with both friendly and hostile Parisians escalate several situations into dangerous confrontations.
In a public restroom, they encounter a survivor of the gulag who tells them a story about a man who froze to death after refusing to relieve himself in public near their transport train and failing to re-board in time. The trio is perplexed by the meaning of the story.
Later, they visit Astérix, a frequent cocaine user who owes money to Saïd. This visit leads to a violent confrontation, as Astérix appears to force Vinz to play Russian roulette, although the gun is secretly unloaded. They encounter sadistic plainclothes police officers who arrest Saïd and Hubert while Vinz manages to escape. The police officers verbally and physically abuse the duo before imprisoning them until late at night, causing the three friends to miss the last train from Saint-Lazare station and spend the night on the streets.
After being kicked out of an art gallery and failing to hotwire a car, the trio takes shelter in a shopping mall. They hear from a news broadcast that Abdel has died. They make their way to a rooftop, where they insult skinheads and policemen. However, they encounter the same group of skinheads who mercilessly attack Saïd and Hubert. Vinz intervenes, holding one of the skinheads at gunpoint. Despite his initial plan to execute him, Vinz hesitates and ultimately lets the skinhead go, prompted by Hubert's astute provocation that challenges Vinz's gangster facade and reveals his true nature.
In the early morning, the trio returns home, and Vinz hands the gun over to Hubert. Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes officer whom Vinz had previously insulted while on a rooftop with his friends. The officer seizes Vinz, threatening him with a loaded gun against his head. Hubert rushes to their aid, but the officer accidentally discharges his gun, killing Vinz. A tense standoff ensues between Hubert and the officer, as Saïd closes his eyes. A single gunshot is heard, leaving it unclear who fired the shot or who may have been struck.
This climactic standoff is accompanied by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("It's about a society in free fall...") and the recurring phrase jusqu'ici tout va bien ("so far so good"). The film portrays a microcosm of French society's descent from hostility into senseless violence, emphasizing that despite appearances, all is not well and the future remains uncertain.
