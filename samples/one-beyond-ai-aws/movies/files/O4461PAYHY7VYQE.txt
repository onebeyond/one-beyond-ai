Plot: The mayor (Altan Erkekli) of a small village in Southeastern Turkey in 1974 bitterly opposes the activities of sleazy opportunist Latif (Cezmi Baskın) who runs open-air film screenings and seeks to break his monopoly over village entertainment with the introduction of the first television (called Vizontele by the locals). However, the TRT team sent to deliver the television leave in a hurry after the delivery, leaving them clueless as to how to set it up. The mayor recruits an eccentric electrician called Emin (Yılmaz Erdoğan) and some of his office staff to help him to set up a television transmitter. While Latif seeks to undermine his efforts by convincing the local imam to decry television as the work of the Devil and a slap in the face of Islamic tradition, the Mayor and Emin's team are initially subjected to ridicule with their initial failures to get a signal until they get it atop the highest peak in town. However, they are disheartened when the television only receives channels from neighboring Iran. As they return, one of their companions hits the TV set in frustration, inadvertently switching the channels to Turkish and prompting celebrations. However, their joy is short-lived as the first news broadcast they watch is about the death of the mayor's son in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The mayor's wife, who has been wary of the television, orders Emin to bury the TV set in place of their son.
The story is based on the childhood memories of the writer-director Yılmaz Erdoğan of the arrival of the first television to Hakkâri in the early 1970s.
