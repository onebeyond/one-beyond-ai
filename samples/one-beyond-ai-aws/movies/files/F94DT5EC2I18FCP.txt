Year: 1999
Rating: 8.8
Plot: The unnamed Narrator, an insomniac dissatisfied with his job and lifestyle, fakes illnesses to attend support groups for therapy. His relief is disrupted when another impostor, Marla Singer, joins the same groups. Viewing her as a mirror to his own deceit, he arranges for them to attend different sessions, to which she reluctantly agrees.
On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden, who critiques his consumerist lifestyle. After an explosion destroys his apartment, he moves in with Tyler and they start Fight Club, a secret fistfighting group, in a bar basement. Meanwhile, Tyler saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.
The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows Fight Club, attracting new members including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing acts of vandalism intended to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's apartment, and then goes missing. When Bob is killed during a mission, the Narrator tries to dismantle Project Mayhem. Discovering its nationwide reach, and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and members, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities.
Learning Tyler plans to erase debt by blowing up buildings with credit records, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, who are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. Accepting that he himself is Tyler, he shoots himself in the head, "killing" Tyler, while the bullet nonfatally passes through the Narrator's cheek.  Marla arrives, and the two hold hands as they watch as the targeted buildings collapse.
