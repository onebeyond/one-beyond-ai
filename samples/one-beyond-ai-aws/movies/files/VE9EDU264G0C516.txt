Plot: On Mars, a few days before Halloween, an unidentified terrorist blows up a truck, spreading an unknown pathogen that kills and sickens hundreds of people. The Mars government offers a huge bounty for the culprit's capture. Faye and Ed identify the terrorist as Vincent Volaju, a soldier who was believed killed on Titan. He survived a test of the pathogen, having been immunized, but amnesia and hallucinations have since driven him insane.
Jet learns that the pathogen is a nanomachine, a biological weapon that has been illegally manufactured by the pharmaceutical company Cherious Medical. Spike encounters Cherious's agent Elektra Ovilo, and he attempts to capture Vincent, but Vincent throws him off a train, then releases another cloud of nanomachines. Everyone else on the train dies, except for Elektra, who was immunized when in a relationship with Vincent. She gives a sample of her blood to a friend at Cherious Medical, and they prepare a stock of vaccine.
Vincent intends to explode giant jack-o'-lantern balloons full of nanomachines, at the Halloween parade, which will kill everyone on Mars. Jet recruits a gang of aged crop-duster pilots to scatter the vaccine, and Faye hijacks the city's weather-control systems to cause rain, assisting in the vaccine's spread. Spike confronts Vincent and the two fight to a standstill. The nanomachines are released, but Spike is cured by the vaccine. Vincent prepares to kill Spike, but is shot by Elektra. He thanks Elektra for their time together, then dies.
