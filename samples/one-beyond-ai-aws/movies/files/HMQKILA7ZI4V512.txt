Plot: In 1958 postwar Britain, Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from the former housekeeper, Miss Kenton. Their past employer, the Earl of Darlington, has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his prewar support of Germany, and his stately country house has been sold to retired US Congressman Jack Lewis. Allowed to borrow the Daimler, Stevens sets off for the West Country to see Miss Kenton for the first time in decades.
A flashback to the 1930s shows Kenton's arrival at Darlington Hall, where the ever-efficient but deeply repressed Stevens derives his entire identity from his profession. He butts heads with the warmer, strong-willed Kenton, particularly when Stevens refuses to acknowledge that his aging father, now an under-butler, is no longer able to perform his duties. Displaying total professionalism, Stevens carries on as his father lies dying during Darlington's conference of like-minded, fascist-sympathising British and European aristocrats. Also in attendance is Congressman Lewis, who admonishes the "gentleman politicians" as meddling amateurs, advising that "Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik" and warning of impending disaster.
Later, Stevens is unable to answer an aristocratic guest's questions on global trade and politics, which the man claims to demonstrate the lower classes' ignorance and inability to govern themselves. Exposed to Nazi racial laws, Darlington has Stevens dismiss two newly appointed, refugee German-Jewish maids, despite his protest. Kenton threatens to resign, but has nowhere to go, while a regretful Darlington is later unable to rehire the maids. Relations thaw between Stevens and Kenton, and she clearly shows her feelings for him, but the outwardly detached Stevens remains dedicated solely to his role as butler. She catches him reading a romance novel, which he explains is to improve his vocabulary, asking her not to invade his privacy again.
Lord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, arrives on the day of a secret meeting at Darlington Hall between British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and German ambassador Joachim von Ribbentrop. Appalled by his godfather's role in seeking appeasement for Nazi Germany, Cardinal tells Stevens that Darlington is being used by the Nazis, but Stevens feels it is not his place to judge his employer. Kenton forms a relationship with former co-worker Tom Benn, and accepts his proposal. She informs Stevens as an ultimatum, but he will not admit his feelings and only offers his congratulations. Finding her crying, his only response is to call her attention to a neglected domestic task, and she leaves Darlington Hall before the start of the Second World War.
En route to meeting Kenton in 1958, Stevens is mistaken for gentry at a pub. Doctor Carlisle, a local GP, helps him refuel the Daimler and deduces that he is actually a manservant, asking his thoughts about Lord Darlington's actions. Denying having even met him, Stevens later admits to having served and respected him, but that Darlington confessed that his Nazi sympathies were misguided and naive. Stevens declares that although Lord Darlington was unable to correct his terrible error, he is attempting to correct his own. He meets Kenton, who has separated from her husband and runs a coastal boarding house. They reminisce that Lord Darlington died from a broken heart after suing a newspaper for libel, losing the suit and his reputation, and Stevens mentions that Cardinal was killed in the war.
Kenton, now Mrs. Benn, declines to resume her position at Darlington Hall, wishing to remain near her pregnant grown daughter and, despite years of unhappiness, she may go back to her husband. Stevens suggests they may never meet again and they part fondly, but are both quietly upset, Miss Kenton visibly tearful as her bus pulls away. Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, where Lewis asks if he remembers the old days, and Stevens replies that he was too busy serving. They free a pigeon from the house and it flies away, leaving Stevens and Darlington Hall far behind.
