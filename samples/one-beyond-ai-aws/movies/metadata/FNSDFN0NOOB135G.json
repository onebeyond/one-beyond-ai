  "plot": "In 1937, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator Jake Gittes to trail her husband Hollis, whom she suspects of infidelity. Hollis Mulwray is chief engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and refuses to build a new dam on safety grounds. Gittes photographs Mulwray in the company of a young woman, and the pictures make their way into the next day's paper.\nGittes is later confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. The fake Evelyn used him to discredit Mulwray. Gittes investigates a reservoir and finds his old police associate, Lieutenant Lou Escobar. Hollis' body was found there, having apparently drowned.\nNow working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Mulwray's death as a homicide. Meanwhile, although there is supposedly a drought, huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and attacked by Mulvihill's henchman. At his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, the fake Mrs. Mulwray. She refuses to say who hired her, but tells Gittes to check that day's obituaries.\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. At his club, Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he searches for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.\nThe Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and Mulwray was murdered when he uncovered the plan. Some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home and confirm that other real-estate deals were transacted in the names of unknowing residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious director, who calls Mulvihill.\nAfter escaping Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. Gittes reveals that, during his days as a police officer in Chinatown, he once tried to protect a woman he loved from being hurt, and ended up making sure she was hurt. During the night, Evelyn receives a phone call that makes her leave. Before that, she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn to a house and sees her comforting Mulwray's mistress. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman hostage, but she claims the woman is her sister, Katherine.\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida's apartment, where he finds her body. Lieutenant Escobar, who is waiting there, says saltwater was found in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds Evelyn gone and the servants packing up the house. In the garden pond, which is saltwater, he spots a pair of eyeglasses. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. Gittes gets violent with Evelyn until she breaks down and reveals that Katherine is her sister and daughter. Evelyn's father raped her when she was 15 years old, and she ran away to Mexico. The eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\nGittes arranges for the women to flee back to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross plans to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. The bifocals are actually Cross's and Gittes accuses him of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals from Gittes at gunpoint. Gittes is then forced to drive them to Chinatown, where Evelyn awaits. The police are already there and detain Gittes. Cross advances on Katherine as she gets into Evelyn's car, identifies himself as her grandfather, and attempts to take her away from Evelyn. Desperate to escape Cross, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and drives away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes and his associates released. One of them urges \"Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.\"",
