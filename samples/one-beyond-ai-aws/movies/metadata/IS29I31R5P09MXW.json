  "plot": "Businessman Adri\u00e1n Doria is out on bail after being arrested for the murder of his lover, Laura Vidal. His lawyer, F\u00e9lix Leiva, hires attorney Virginia Goodman, who visits him at his apartment with the news that the prosecutor has found a witness who will be testifying in front of a judge soon; they have three hours to come up with a defense, so Virginia urges Adri\u00e1n to tell her the whole truth.\nAdri\u00e1n tells Virginia how he and Laura had ended their affair but received a call blackmailing them to come to a rural hotel with \u20ac100,000. At the hotel, Adri\u00e1n was knocked unconscious and awoke to find Laura dead in the bathroom. With the door and the windows locked from inside the police found Adri\u00e1n to be the only suspect.\nAdri\u00e1n then narrates further back, how he claimed to be in Paris but was really in a cabin with Laura. As they drive back to Barcelona, Adri\u00e1n swerves to avoid a deer, clipping another car, which hits a tree. Although they are unhurt, the other car's driver, a bank employee (Daniel Garrido), died. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting and not wearing his belt. When another car approaches, Laura hides the body, and she and Adri\u00e1n pretend to exchange insurance information. She pretends to answer Daniel's phone when it rings, and the driver leaves. Laura waits for a tow truck in Adri\u00e1n's car, which will not start, while Adri\u00e1n dumps Daniel's car in a lake with the body inside.\nLaura later picks up Adri\u00e1n and tells him how his car was repaired. An automotive engineer, Tom\u00e1s, drove by and offered to help Laura, who claimed she had hit a deer. He towed the car to his house to fix it. While talking to Tom\u00e1s's wife, Elvira, Laura realized Daniel was their son. When leaving in the repaired car, Laura adjusted the driver's seat arousing Tom\u00e1s's suspicion about the car owner. Adri\u00e1n sells his car and reports it stolen, and parts ways with Laura.\nAdri\u00e1n is summoned to the police, as Tom\u00e1s has reported his plate number. F\u00e9lix concocts an alibi for Adri\u00e1n and manages to remove his name from the case file. When the news report that Daniel is on the run after embezzling money from the bank, Adri\u00e1n confronts Laura, who admits that she took Daniel's wallet, and later hacked into Daniel's account and stole the money. Confronted by Adri\u00e1n about this, Laura threatens to frame him too.\nTom\u00e1s poses as a reporter during a public event attended by Adri\u00e1n, noticing that Adri\u00e1n pulls out the same lighter he saw when fixing the car. He begs Adri\u00e1n to reveal the corpse's location. Days later, Adri\u00e1n receives instructions to take Laura to the rural hotel with \u20ac100,000. Adri\u00e1n thinks the blackmailer may be the passing driver, had he followed Adri\u00e1n afterwards.\nVirginia suggests that Adri\u00e1n could claim he saw the face of the man who hit him in the rural hotel room and that the attacker was Tom\u00e1s. Adri\u00e1n then reveals he has always known it was Tom\u00e1s but he did not tell because he was testing Virginia. Virginia suggests planting an item belonging to Laura in Daniel's car, and claiming she acted alone. Adri\u00e1n then confesses that as he was pushing the car into the lake, Daniel was alive; an autopsy would reveal he drowned.\nUpon learning about Laura's anxiety, Virginia suggests Adri\u00e1n is lying about Laura being the femme fatale behind their deceit. However, Virginia says she believes Tom\u00e1s framed him because Elvira worked at the rural hotel, and that is why the Garridos chose it for the rendezvous: Elvira could have easily unlocked the window for Tom\u00e1s to escape after killing Laura, and later locked the window, making it seem like nobody else came in. Virginia says Tom\u00e1s has been stalking Adri\u00e1n, F\u00e9lix and even herself, and points to an apartment across the street, where Tom\u00e1s is lurking. Adri\u00e1n finally admits that he killed Laura and staged the scene.\nF\u00e9lix leaves a message on Adri\u00e1n's voicemail, urging him to call back. Virginia suggests Adri\u00e1n to return the call during a break, and she hastily leaves. F\u00e9lix reports Adri\u00e1n that the witness is indeed the other driver, but his silence was bought. As F\u00e9lix questions how the meeting with Virginia is going, the call is getting disturbed with high-pitched tones, Adri\u00e1n then realizes that their entire conversation is being recorded. He recalls Virginia turning off his phone. He looks into the apartment across the street and sees Tom\u00e1s next to Virginia, who reveals herself to be Elvira Garrido in disguise. Using the confession, Tom\u00e1s calls the police as the real Virginia Goodman arrives at Adri\u00e1n's apartment.",
