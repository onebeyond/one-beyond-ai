  "plot": "In London, film student Sue McKinley finds the diary of her grandfather James, who served as a colonel of the British Army in the 1930s. James oversaw the capture and execution of the three freedom fighters \u2013 Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru \u2013 at the Lahore Jail and has written in his diary about his admiration for their revolutionary spirit, in spite of his being an officer of the British Empire.\n\nInspired by the revolutionaries' story, Sue decides to make a film on them. She travels to India, where she searches for actors with the help of her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan), a student of international studies at the University of Delhi. Amid a string of unsuccessful auditions, Sue meets Sonia's friends: Daljit \"DJ\" Singh (Aamir Khan), Karan Singhania (Siddharth), Sukhi Ram (Sharman Joshi) and Aslam Khan (Kunal Kapoor). She immediately decides to cast them in her film, with DJ as Chandra Shekhar Azad, Karan Singhania as Bhagat Singh, Aslam Khan as Ashfaqulla Khan, and Sukhi Ram as Shivaram Rajguru.\n\nDJ, Aslam, Sukhi and the spendthrift Karan, who is the son of political well-connected businessman Rajnath Singhania, are at once carefree and cynical about their futures. While they get along well with Sue, they remain uninterested in working on a film expressing patriotism towards India. Tensions arise when Sue casts the boys' rival, the right-wing party activist Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), as Ram Prasad Bismil. However, over the course of working on the film, Pandey grows closer to the others. Sue begins a relationship with DJ.\n\nThe group becomes devastated when Sonia's fianc\u00e9 Ajay Singh Rathod, a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force, is killed when his MiG-21 jet malfunctions and crashes. The government attributes the accident to pilot error and closes the case, but Sonia and her friends refuse to accept the official explanation, remembering Ajay as a skilled pilot who died while steering the plane away from crashing into a populous city. They learn that the corrupt Defense Minister Shastri signed a contract importing cheap parts for MiG-21 aircraft in exchange for a personal favor. Karan is severely jolted when he realizes that his father Rajnath was involved in orchestrating the deal.\n\nSince working on the film has already made them imbibe idealism and galvanized them against government corruption, the group organizes a peaceful protest at the India Gate. The police arrive and violently break up the peaceful demonstration; Ajay's mother Aishwarya is beaten by the police and goes into a coma. Laxman realizes that his senior party official, Raghuvir Mishra, was in league with the government officials who ordered the police to stop the protest and becomes disillusioned with his own party. Inspired by the revolutionaries, the group decides to take action themselves. They assassinate Shastri to avenge Ajay's death, while Karan confronts and murders Rajnath.\n\nThe media reports that Shastri was killed by terrorists and celebrates him as a martyr. The group decides to publicly clarify their intent behind the assassination, and towards this end, they take over the All India Radio station after evacuating its employees and after alerting Karan's friend Rahul, who works there and is live (on air) at the moment. Karan goes on air and calls out the defense ministry's corruption to the public. The police arrive at the station under instructions to kill them. Sukhi is shot dead, while Aslam and Laxman are killed by a grenade and DJ is severely injured. DJ reunites with Karan in the recording room as the latter finishes his public statement, and the two of them get killed together.\n\nNews of the boys' death enrages the public, spurring a wave of demonstrations against the Indian government. Aishwarya awakes from her coma. The film ends with Sue describing the personal impact of meeting the boys and working on the film, while the deceased boys are seen in an afterlife-like state meeting a young Bhagat Singh in his family garden.",
