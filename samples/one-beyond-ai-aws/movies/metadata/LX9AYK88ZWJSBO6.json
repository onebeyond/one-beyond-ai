  "plot": "Nine years since rekindling their relationship, Jesse and C\u00e9line have become parents to twin girls. Jesse reflects on his inability to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank. Hank flies home to Chicago after vacationing with the couple and their children on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, and lives with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife.\nJesse is a successful novelist, while C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government. The couple discuss their concerns over Hank, as well as C\u00e9line's career, and reflect on love and life over dinner with friends. Their friends pay for a hotel room for the couple; while walking to the hotel, Jesse and C\u00e9line reminisce about their initial meetings, and wonder if they would become a couple if they met in their present state.\nAfter reaching the hotel, they begin to get intimate but are interrupted by a phone call from Hank, who seems to have bonded with C\u00e9line more than Jesse. They eventually have a fierce argument, expressing fears about the strength of their relationship. Jesse wants them to consider moving to Chicago so he can be closer to Hank, which C\u00e9line thinks will cost her any chance of a career outside her family. During the argument, C\u00e9line leaves and returns twice. Then she tells Jesse she thinks she no longer loves him.\nC\u00e9line leaves their room the third time and sits alone in the hotel's outdoor restaurant. Jesse joins her and jokes that he is a time traveler (referencing their first meeting), bringing her a letter from her 82-year-old self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. Unamused, C\u00e9line says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality. Jesse says while their love may be imperfect, it is real. After a moment, C\u00e9line joins in Jesse's joke, and the two reconcile.",
