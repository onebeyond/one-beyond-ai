  "plot": "At the tail end of the Irish Civil War in the spring of 1923, on the Irish isle of Inisherin (literally \"the island of Ireland\"), fiddler Colm Doherty abruptly begins ignoring his lifelong best friend and drinking buddy P\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in. Colm has decided that P\u00e1draic, a man respected by the islanders, is too dull for him, and he would rather spend the remainder of his life composing music and doing things for which he will be remembered. P\u00e1draic is devastated and refuses to accept the rejection, while Colm only becomes more resistant to his old friend's attempts to make amends. Colm eventually gives P\u00e1draic an ultimatum: every time P\u00e1draic comes to talk with him, Colm will cut off one of his own fingers.\nThe local Garda, Peadar, beats his troubled son Dominic severely for drinking his alcohol, and P\u00e1draic and his sister Siobh\u00e1n take Dominic in for a night. While delivering milk to the market, P\u00e1draic is insulted by Peadar and retaliates by making public the fact that Peadar abuses his son. Peadar punches him to the ground. Having witnessed this, Colm drives P\u00e1draic home; the two do not speak.\nSiobh\u00e1n and Dominic try to defuse the pair's feud, to no avail. P\u00e1draic drunkenly confronts Colm in the pub over his lack of \"niceness\", also chastising Peadar over the fact that he molests Dominic. Colm remarks that this is the most interesting P\u00e1draic has been and mutters: \"I think I like him again now.\" The next morning, not remembering what he has said, P\u00e1draic attempts to apologise to Colm but the conversation goes badly. Colm responds by cutting off his left index finger and throwing it at P\u00e1draic's door.\nP\u00e1draic later sees Colm meeting with a fiddler from the mainland. Jealous, P\u00e1draic tricks the fiddler into returning home by lying about his father being hit by a bread van. As the tensions worsen, local elder Mrs. McCormick warns P\u00e1draic that death will come to the island soon. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n sympathetically rejects Dominic's romantic advances.\nP\u00e1draic tells Dominic about what he did to the fiddler, and Dominic expresses his disappointment in P\u00e1draic's behaviour. P\u00e1draic becomes convinced that this will make him interesting enough for Colm and visits him, starting another confrontation. Colm reveals he has finished composing his song, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". P\u00e1draic thinks they have come to a point of reconciliation and invites Colm to the pub, but before leaving, P\u00e1draic mentions he lied to the fiddler to get him off the island. Instead of meeting P\u00e1draic at the pub, Colm cuts off all four of his remaining left fingers and throws them at Padraic's door.\nBored of life on the island and disgusted by the pair's feud, Siobh\u00e1n moves to the mainland for a job in a library. P\u00e1draic comes home to find his pet donkey Jenny has choked on one of Colm's fingers and died. He tells Colm he will burn his house down the next day at 2:00 p.m., regardless of whether Colm is in it. The next day P\u00e1draic sets fire to Colm's house as promised. P\u00e1draic looks in a window and sees Colm calmly sitting inside. P\u00e1draic leaves, taking Colm's dog Sammy with him. Peadar goes to P\u00e1draic's house, but is led away by Mrs. McCormick, who takes him to Dominic's corpse floating in the nearby lake.\nThe next morning, P\u00e1draic, with Sammy, finds Colm standing on the beach beside his burnt-out house. Colm apologises for the donkey's death and suggests destroying the house has ended their war. P\u00e1draic informs him that it only would have ended if he had stayed inside the house. Having not heard rifle fire from the mainland recently, Colm wonders if the Civil War is coming to an end, P\u00e1draic replies he is sure the fighting will begin again soon because \"some things there's no moving on from and I think that's a good thing\". As P\u00e1draic turns to leave, Colm thanks him for looking after Sammy. \"Any time,\" P\u00e1draic responds. Unbeknownst to them, Mrs. McCormick is observing them from a distance by Colm's burned cottage.",
