  "plot": "The film opens with three unrelated stories of deaths under synchronistic circumstances.\nOfficer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman's apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Her neighbors called the police after she argued with her estranged father, Jimmy Gator, and blasted music while snorting cocaine. Unaware of her addiction, Jim asks her on a date.\nJimmy hosts a quiz show called What Do Kids Know? and is dying of cancer. The newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the adults, who prevent him from using the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself. As the show continues, a drunken Jimmy sickens, ordering the show to go on after he collapses. After Stanley's father berates him, Stanley runs away.\nFormer What Do Kids Know? champion Donnie Smith watches the show from a bar. His parents took all his prize money. He has been fired from his job due to performance issues and is in love with a male bartender with braces. Donnie is obsessed with getting braces himself, thinking the bartender will love him back. He hatches a plan to steal the money from his boss for the surgery.\nThe show's former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of cancer. Earl's trophy wife, Linda, collects his prescriptions while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a motivational speaker and pickup artist. Frank is interviewed by a journalist who knows Frank took care of his dying mother after Earl left. Frank storms out of the interview, after which Phil tries to contact him.\nLinda goes to see Earl's lawyer, hoping to change Earl's will. She married Earl for the money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and decline the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and takes handfuls of medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda near death in the car, robs her, and calls an ambulance.\nJim loses his gun while trying to catch a suspect. When he meets Claudia, they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she leaves him.\nJimmy goes home to his wife, Rose, and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember. Rose leaves him.\nDonnie takes the money from his employer's safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money but cannot get back in. While climbing a utility pole to the roof, Jim sees him. Suddenly, frogs begin falling from the sky. One of them hits Donnie, and he falls from the pole and smashes his teeth. As Jimmy is about to kill himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the television and cause a house fire. Rose crashes her car near Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter. Earl is awakened and sees Frank beside him before dying. Linda's ambulance crashes near the hospital. Donnie is rescued by Jim, and the gun falls from the sky. \nJim helps Donnie return the money. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover. Stanley tells his father that he needs to be nice to him, but he tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them. As Jim is explaining, Claudia smiles.",
