  "plot": "After Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals Peter's identity as Spider-Man, Peter, his girlfriend Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson, best friend Ned Leeds, and his aunt, May Parker are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Peter, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories, ultimately causing Strange to contain the spell to stop it.\nAt Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider the applications of MJ and Ned, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips nanotechnology from Peter's Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.\nOsborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. building, where May comforts him before Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first cure the villains of the insanity that would lead to their deaths, to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. Before Peter can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter from the villains' universes who were also summoned by Strange's spell and who are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe's Peter, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor, and the three Peters develop cures for the villains.\nThe group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker's identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange to do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes\u2014including Eddie Brock, who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.",
