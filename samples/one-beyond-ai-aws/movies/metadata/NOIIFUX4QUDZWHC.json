  "plot": "In 1973, sports handicapper and Mafia associate Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein is sent by the Chicago Mafia to Las Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino, with front man Philip Green. Sam soon doubles the casino's profits, with the extra unaccounted for cash skimmed directly from the casino count room, and delivered to the Midwest Mafia bosses. Chicago boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicky Santoro to protect Sam, the cash skim, and the casino. Nicky recruits his younger brother Dominick and childhood friend Frankie Marino to gather an experienced crew that specializes in shakedowns and jewelry burglaries. Nicky's Las Vegas criminal activities start drawing too much media and police attention and he is eventually placed in the Black Book, banning him from every casino in Nevada.\nSam meets and falls in love with beautiful hustler, showgirl, and former prostitute Ginger McKenna. They have a daughter, Amy, and marry, but their marriage is soon thrown into turmoil due to Ginger's relationship with her longtime boyfriend, con artist Lester Diamond. Sam has Nicky's crew beat Lester when they catch him accepting $25,000 from her.\nIn 1976, Sam fires slot manager Don Ward for incompetence. Ward is brother-in-law to Clark County Commission chairman Pat Webb, who is unable to convince Sam to re-hire Ward. Webb arranges for Sam's gaming license to be denied, jeopardizing Sam's position. Sam starts hosting a local television talk show from inside the casino, irritating both Nicky and the bosses back home for bringing more unneeded attention. Sam blames Nicky's recklessness for ongoing police and state government pressure, and Sam's attempts to get Nicky to leave Las Vegas only result in further strain on their friendship.\nWhen the Midwest bosses discover that people on the inside are stealing from their skim, they install incompetent Kansas City underboss Artie Piscano to oversee the operation. Disobeying orders, Piscano keeps detailed written records of the operation. Additionally, an FBI bug placed in Piscano's grocery store catches him talking in detail about the skim, prompting a full investigation into the Tangiers Casino.\nIn 1980, Ginger kidnaps little Amy, planning to flee to Europe with her and Lester. Sam convinces Ginger to return with Amy, then overhears her planning on the phone to kill him. Enraged, Sam kicks her out of their home but relents and forgives her. Ginger confides in Nicky about the situation, and the two start an affair. Sam soon discovers their affair, confronts Ginger and ends his friendship with Nicky. Nicky ends his affair with Ginger once she asks him to kill Sam and threatens to go to the FBI. Ginger leaves Sam and takes all of her money and jewelry, then approached by the FBI, tells them nothing, but they already have all the evidence they need.\nIn 1982, the FBI discovers Piscano's records, closes the Tangiers, and Green agrees to cooperate. The FBI approaches Sam for help by showing him photos of Nicky and Ginger together, but he turns them down. The Chicago bosses are arrested, get ready for trial, murdering anyone who might testify against them. \nIn 1983, Ginger dies of a hot dose, presumably orchestrated by the mob. That same year, Sam narrowly survives a car bomb, suspecting Nicky to be the culprit. Sam states that the bosses did not authorize the bombing, because they had \"other ideas\" for him.\nIn 1986, the bosses, finally fed up with Nicky's recklessness, order Frankie and his crew to kill Nicky and Dominick. Invited to attend a meetup in an Illinois remote cornfield, they are brutally beaten there with baseball bats, stripped of their clothes and buried alive in a shallow grave. With the Mafia now out of the casino industry, nearly all of the old casinos are demolished, and new casinos are built with money from junk bonds. Sam laments the new impersonal, corporate-run resorts of Las Vegas. Because of his status as a reliable and high earner for the outfit, Sam is allowed to live and is last seen working as a sports handicapper in San Diego, \"right back where I started,\" as Sam puts it before rhetorically asking, \"Why mess up a good thing? And that's that.\"",
