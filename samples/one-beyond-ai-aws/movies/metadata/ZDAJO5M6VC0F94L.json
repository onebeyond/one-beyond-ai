  "plot": "Ted Kramer, a workaholic advertising executive in New York City, has just landed an important account and been promoted. However, when he shares the news with his wife Joanna, he discovers that she is leaving him and their son Billy. Initially, Ted and Billy struggle to bond as Ted's workload increases and Billy misses his mother. Nevertheless, they eventually learn to cope and form a strong connection.\nTed befriends his neighbor Margaret Phelps, to whom Joanna had confided. As fellow single parents, Ted and Margaret become close friends. While watching their children play in the park, Billy falls off the jungle gym and is injured. Ted rushes him to the hospital and comforts him during treatment.\nFifteen months later, Joanna returns from California to claim custody of Billy, leading to a contentious legal battle. Their lawyers resort to brutal character assassinations, and Margaret is compelled to testify against Ted, revealing that she had advised Joanna to leave him. Ted's job loss and Billy's accident are also used to discredit him.\nDespite his desire to appeal, Ted's lawyer advises against it, as putting Billy on the stand would be emotionally damaging. Ted eventually decides not to contest custody. On the day Joanna comes to collect Billy, Ted and Billy prepare breakfast together. Joanna tells Ted that she wishes she had painted Billy's new room like his old one and tearfully admits that his true home is with Ted. As Joanna enters the elevator to talk to Billy, Ted tells her she looks \"terrific.\"",
