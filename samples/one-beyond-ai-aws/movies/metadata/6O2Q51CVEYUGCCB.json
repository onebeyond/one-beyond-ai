  "plot": "Two years after Solomon Lane's capture, the remnants of the Syndicate have reorganized as a terrorist group known as the Apostles, having adopted a 'terror for hire' policy. They are hired by an extremist known as John Lark and are attempting to acquire three stolen plutonium cores for him to use in three nuclear bombs. IMF Agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to recover the plutonium. During a mission in Berlin, the Apostles take fellow teammate Luther Stickell hostage. Ethan chooses to save Luther, allowing the Apostles to steal the cores. The IMF team later captures Norwegian nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, whom the CIA believes is building nuclear weapons for Lark. Using a fake broadcast of teammate Benji Dunn posing as CNN's Wolf Blitzer and announcing the bombings of Rome, Jerusalem, and Mecca, they trick Delbruuk into unlocking a phone he used to communicate with Lark.\nFurious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erika Sloane instructs Special Activities Division Agent August Walker to accompany Ethan on a mission to retrieve it. Ethan and Walker infiltrate a Paris nightclub where Lark is supposed to purchase the plutonium from the Apostles, with arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis acting as a broker. They track a man they suspect to be Lark, but after an intense fight in the men's restroom, he is killed by MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Ethan assumes the identity of Lark and meets with Mitsopolis, but the meeting is cut short when hitmen attack the meeting. In exchange for the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Ethan with extracting Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris, and provides one of the cores as a down payment. \nEthan and Walker preemptively attack the convoy to prevent Mitsopolis' brother Zola and their men from killing local police. They lead the police, Mitsopolis's men, and Faust on a chase while Benji and Luther secure Lane. Mitsopolis then instructs Ethan to deliver Lane to London. At a London safe house, IMF Secretary Hunley tells Ethan that he has received doctored evidence implicating Ethan as Lark. The team tricks Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and informs Sloane, who sends a CIA SAD unit to take everyone into custody. However, the unit has been infiltrated by the Apostles and is under Walker's command. \nWalker kills Hunley, and Ethan pursues him to Tate Modern, where Walker threatens Ethan's ex-wife, Julia, before escaping by helicopter. The team, along with Ilsa, tracks Lane and Walker to a medical camp over the Siachen Glacier. Ilsa deduces that Lane is planning to detonate the nuclear bombs at the medical camp, contaminating the water supply of India, Pakistan, and China, resulting in the destruction of 1/3 of the world's population. The bombs are linked by a failsafe; any attempt to defuse one bomb without also disarming the detonator will trigger the other. Ethan discovers that Julia and her new husband, Erik, are working at the camp. Lane programs the bombs' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and gives it to Walker. \nWalker takes off in a helicopter while Benji, Luther, and Ilsa try to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Julia helps Luther disarm the first bomb, but they are unable to defuse it without the detonator. Ilsa finds the second bomb but is ambushed and subdued by Lane; Benji and Ilsa eventually overpower him. Ethan hijacks an escort helicopter and manages to ram Walker's out of the sky. The two men fight on the edge of a cliff, which ends when Ethan drops a hook attached to a helicopter on Walker and sends him falling to his death into the exploding helicopter. Ethan secures the detonator, allowing the team to deactivate the bombs. In the aftermath, Julia thanks Ethan for giving her the best life because of his commitment to the IMF. Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, earning Ilsa her exoneration, and praises Ethan for his actions.",
