  "plot": "A handsome young man wakes up to a female voice telling him to open his eyes. He drives to an empty city. He wakes again, this time to a woman in his bed. He tells her not to leave him messages on his alarm clock.\nFrom a prison cell in Madrid, the 25-year-old man, C\u00e9sar (Eduardo Noriega), tells his story to psychiatrist Antonio (Chete Lera) while wearing a prosthetic mask. Flashbacks reveal the following events: Good-looking C\u00e9sar is attractive to women. At his birthday party, he flirts with Sof\u00eda (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), his best friend Pelayo's (Fele Martinez) date. Later, he takes her home and stays the night, but they do not sleep together. The next morning, C\u00e9sar's obsessive ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) pulls up outside Sof\u00eda's flat, offering him a ride and sex. On the way to her house, however, she crashes the car with the intent to kill them both. C\u00e9sar survives the crash but is horribly disfigured, beyond the help of cosmetic surgery, so he decides to wear a mask to conceal his face. Sof\u00eda cannot bear to see him and tries to keep her distance.\nAfter C\u00e9sar's disfigurement, he begins to have a series of disorienting experiences. Drunk, C\u00e9sar falls asleep in the street. On awakening, everything has changed: Sof\u00eda now claims to love him and the surgeons restore his lost looks. But as he makes love to Sof\u00eda one night, she suddenly changes into Nuria. Horrified, C\u00e9sar smothers her to death with a pillow. Yet everyone else believes Nuria was indeed the woman everyone else calls Sof\u00eda, and he is imprisoned for her murder.\nWhile he is confined to the prison, fragments of his past return to him as if in a dream. It is revealed that, shortly after falling asleep drunk on the street, C\u00e9sar signed a contract with Life Extension, a company specializing in cryonics, to be cryogenically preserved and to experience extremely lucid and lifelike virtual reality dreams. Returning to their headquarters, under supervision by prison officers, he discovers they specialize in cryonics with a twist: \"artificial perception\" or the provision of a fantasy based on the past to clients who are reborn in the future. He committed suicide at home shortly after signing the contract and was placed in cryonic suspension. Duvernois, the L.E. representative who explains C\u00e9sar's experiences to him while dreaming, reveals that the era is 150 years in the future and C\u00e9sar's time from his awakening in the street onward has been a dream, spliced retroactively into his actual life and replacing his true memories. At the end of the film, C\u00e9sar decides to wake and be resurrected by committing suicide. Convinced his life since the drunken night in the street has been a nightmarish vision created by Life Extension, he leaps from the roof of the company's high-rise headquarters, and the film ends, apparently ambiguously, on a black screen with a woman telling him to open his eyes.",
