  "plot": "Seth and Evan are childhood best friends and high school seniors who are about to go off to different colleges. \nSeth's crush, Jules, invites him to a party at her house. Seth and Evan's friend Fogell plans to obtain a fake ID, so Seth promises to buy Jules alcohol for the party. Evan runs into his own crush, Becca, and offers to get her a specific bottle of vodka.\nDespite Fogell's fake ID having only one name \u2013 \"McLovin\" \u2013 he successfully buys the liquor but is knocked out at the last second by a robber. When police officers Slater and Michaels arrive, Seth and Evan, who are outside, believe that Fogell is being arrested; in reality, the officers have agreed to give \"McLovin\" a ride to the party.\nWhile outside the liquor store, Seth is hit by a motorist. In exchange for Seth and Evan not telling the police, the driver promises to take them to another party, where they can get alcohol. Meanwhile, Slater and Michaels take Fogell on a ride-along and then bond with him. Despite being on duty, they start drinking, use their sirens improperly and shoot at a stop sign.\nAt the party, Seth fills laundry detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol and dances with a drunk girl. She stains his leg with menstrual blood, while a group of intoxicated men make Evan sing \"These Eyes\" for them. Seth is confronted by the party's host for dancing with his fianc\u00e9e, and a brawl ensues; the police are called, while Seth and Evan escape.\nSeth begins to chastise Evan for bailing on him; explaining that they had made childhood plans to go to college together but Evan got into a more difficult college. Evan retorts that Seth is selfish and has held him back for years, concluding he doesn't want Seth to slow him down anymore. As they begin to argue more, Seth is again hit by a car \u2013 the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. They plan to pin the blame of the crash on Seth, but as Fogell emerges from the car, Evan makes a run for it, and Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. Eventually, all three make their way to Jules' party.\nAt the party, Fogell inadvertently reveals that he and Evan will be rooming together at college, upsetting Seth. Seth's stories of the night's antics make him popular, while Becca wants to have sex with Evan, who declines since she is drunk.\nMeanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola, an attractive foreign exchange student, and goes upstairs to have sex with her. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because she neither drinks nor wants Seth while he is drunk. He believes he has ruined his chances with her, then passes out, accidentally headbutting Jules and giving her a black eye.\nSlater and Michaels bust the party. Seth wakes up and escapes, carrying an intoxicated Evan. Slater busts in on Fogell and Nicola having sex, causing her to run off. Slater yells at Fogell for ditching them, but Michaels points out they just interrupted him. They apologize and reveal they knew all along that Fogell was underage but played along, wanting to show cops can have fun too. To make it up to Fogell, they pretend to arrest him outside to make him look \"badass.\" They resume their bonding, eventually destroying their car with a Molotov cocktail while Fogell shoots it with Slater's gun.\nSeth and Evan have a sleepover together at Evan\u2019s, where Seth reveals that he learned weeks earlier that Evan and Fogell planned to live together at college. Evan admits he does not want to room with Fogell but is afraid to live with strangers. They apologize to each other before reconciling. \nThe next day, Seth and Evan visit the mall and run into Jules and Becca. Becca and Seth apologize for their drunken behavior, and the boys pair off with the girls: Seth takes Jules to buy concealer for the black eye he gave her, while Evan and Becca leave to buy a comforter to replace the one she drunkenly vomited on.",
