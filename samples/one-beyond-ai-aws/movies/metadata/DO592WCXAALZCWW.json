  "plot": "In 1991, slacker and avid bowler Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is attacked in his Los Angeles home by two enforcers for porn kingpin Jackie Treehorn, to whom a different Jeffrey Lebowski's wife owes money. One enforcer urinates on the Dude's rug before the two realize that they have the wrong man and leave.\nConsulting his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and fall guy Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (\"the big Lebowski\"), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses, but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowski's trophy wife, and her German nihilist friend Uli. Soon afterwards, Bunny is apparently kidnapped, and Lebowski hires The Dude to deliver the ransom money, one million dollars. That night, another group of thugs ambush the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski's daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it.\nThe kidnappers arrange to collect the ransom. Convinced that the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter schemes to keep the money for the Dude and himself, substituting it with a bag of his dirty laundry. The plan fails, the kidnappers leave with Walter's bag, and he and The Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the car trunk. While they bowl, the car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny's. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money, which her father illegally withdrew from the family's charity foundation.\nThe Dude receives a call from the police telling him that his car has been found and taken to an impound lot. While retrieving the car, he notices that the briefcase is missing and finds a piece of homework belonging to teenager Larry Sellers. Walter and the Dude drive to Larry's house and interrogate him, but cannot get any information out of him. To intimidate Larry, Walter smashes a sports car that he believes the teenager purchased with the stolen money. Enraged, the car's real owner destroys the Dude's car in retaliation, believing it to be Walter's.\nThe Dude is abducted by Jackie Treehorn's thugs and taken to see the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and that his money is with Larry. The Dude passes out after drinking a spiked White Russian given to him by Treehorn, and has a dream in which he envisions an elaborate Busby Berkeley-style musical sequence featuring himself and Maude. After waking up, he is arrested and taken to a police station, where its chief warns him to stay out of Malibu. On the ride home, the Dude is thrown out of his taxi after complaining about the driver's selection of The Eagles' music on the car radio. At that moment, Bunny drives by in her car, with all her toes shown to be intact. In a later scene, it is revealed that the severed toe actually came from the girlfriend of one of the nihilists.\nReturning home, The Dude finds Maude, who has sex with him. She is trying to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact socially. Her father has no money of his own; his wealth came from her late mother.\nThe Dude and Walter confront Lebowski, and find that Bunny has returned, having simply gone out of town without telling anyone. Bunny's nihilist friends had taken the opportunity to blackmail Lebowski, who, in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase given to him never contained any money. An enraged Walter insists that Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair. However, the paralysis turns out to be real.\nWalter and The Dude are bowling, when an angry Jesus Quintana interrupts them. Walter previously stated that since he is shomer Shabbos, he could not bowl on a Saturday. In a tirade, Quintana implies that he does not believe in Walter's excuses for not bowling on Saturday. Quintana threatens Walter and The Dude with violence and storms out. Outside of the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dude's car, and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off. However, during the altercation, Donny dies from a heart attack. Walter scatters Donny's ashes from a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but they are blown back over himself and the Dude by an updraft. The Dude loses his temper and yells at Walter, who consoles him, and the two then go bowling.\nAt the bowling alley the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movie's narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the movie and states that while he \"didn't like seeing Donny go\", he remains optimistic and that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski on the way.\"",
