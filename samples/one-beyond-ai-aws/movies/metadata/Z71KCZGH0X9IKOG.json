  "plot": "On Christmas Day, 1560, several scores of Spanish conquistadors, and a hundred native slaves, march down from the newly conquered Inca Empire in the Andes mountains into the jungles to the east, in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. Under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro, the men, clad in half armor, pull cannons down narrow mountain paths and through dense, muddy jungle. On New Year's Eve, reaching the end of his supplies and unable to go on without more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. \nIf they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don Pedro de Urs\u00faa as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre as his second-in-command, fat nobleman Don Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n to represent the Royal House of Spain, and Brother Gaspar de Carvajal to bring the word of God. Accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro's better judgment, are Urs\u00faa's mistress, Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, and Aguirre's teenage daughter, Flores.\nTraveling through rapids, one of the four rafts gets caught in an eddy, and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning the men on board are found dead, with three missing. Urs\u00faa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for proper burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre suggests that Perucho fire the cannon to clean the rust from it. He fires at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.\nDuring the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Urs\u00faa decides to return to Pizarro's group despite the danger from hostile Indians. Aguirre leads a mutiny against Urs\u00faa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s won an empire in Mexico by disobeying orders. Urs\u00faa orders Aguirre arrested, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Aguirre nominates Guzm\u00e1n as the new leader of the expedition and rebels against the Spanish Crown, proclaiming Guzm\u00e1n the emperor of El Dorado. A farcical trial of Urs\u00faa results in his being sentenced to death, but Guzm\u00e1n surprises Aguirre by granting Urs\u00faa clemency.\nAguirre remains the true leader of the mutiny, so oppressive and terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only In\u00e9s has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Urs\u00faa, Aguirre simply ignores her.\nThe expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An indigenous couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion when presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for blasphemy. Guzm\u00e1n dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition's only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him. Soon afterwards he is found dead near the raft's privy. After Guzm\u00e1n's death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Urs\u00faa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an indigenous village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught In\u00e9s walks into the jungle and disappears.\nOn the raft again, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a wooden ship perched in the highest branches of a tall tree, which Aguirre orders be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of final attacks by unseen assailants, the remaining survivors including Aguirre's daughter are killed by arrows. Monkeys overrun the raft as Aguirre imagines conquering all of America and founding an incestuous dynasty to rule over it.",
