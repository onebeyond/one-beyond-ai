  "plot": "In the winter of 1823, Antonio Salieri is committed to a psychiatric hospital after barring his doors and having a suicide attempt, during which his servants overhear him confess to murdering Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A young priest, Father Vogler approaches Salieri for elaboration on Salieri's confession. Salieri plays two of his melodies with Vogler admitting he doesn't know them. Salieri then plays Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, which Vogler knows perfectly well. Unsurprised that Vogler knows this melody but not his, Salieri recounts how, ever since he remembered, he desired to be a composer, much to his father's chagrin. He prays to God that if He allows Salieri to become a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness, chastity and diligence. Soon after, his father chokes on his food and dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri had become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. \nSeven years later, at a reception in honour of Mozart's patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri anxiously awaits to meet his idol, guessing about his identity. He is very shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene, silly, and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift to Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart's talent to make Salieri a mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.\nMeanwhile, Mozart's alcoholism ruins his health, marriage, finances and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work. Salieri hires a young girl to work as Mozart's maid (against his father Leopold's better judgment) so he may gain access to his apartment, where he discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play The Marriage of Figaro, which the Emperor has forbidden owing to its subversive theme. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief.\nSalieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder invited him to write an opera for his theatre. Mozart obliges despite his wife Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem, as the opera is a riskier venture financially. After arguing with Mozart, Constanze leaves with their young son, Karl.\nThe opera in question, The Magic Flute, is a great success, but the overworked Mozart collapses during one performance. Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue writing the Requiem, offering to take the bedridden Mozart's dictation; the two lay down the opening of the Confutatis together. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and appalled at finding Mozart working with Salieri demands that Salieri leave immediately. In her guilt, she locks the unfinished Requiem away in a cabinet, keeping it away from both composers. Constanze and Salieri argue with each other. Constanze walks over to Mozart's bed to find that he has passed away. Mozart is taken out of the city in a rainy day and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave.\nBack in 1823, Vogler was too shook to absolve Salieri, who surmised that the \"merciful\" God preferred to destroy His beloved Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of his glory. Salieri promises, with bitter irony, to both pray for and absolve Vogler along with all the world's mediocrities as their \"patron saint\". As Salieri is wheeled down a hallway, absolving the hospital's patients of their inadequacies as he passes by, Mozart's laughter rings in the air, as a reminder of his glee for his talent.",
