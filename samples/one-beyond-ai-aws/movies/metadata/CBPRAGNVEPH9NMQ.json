When Yuzuru runs away from home, Sh\u014dya offers to let her stay at his house, and the two reconcile.\nSh\u014dya helps Sh\u014dko reconnect with Miyoko Sahara, a kind classmate who genuinely befriended Sh\u014dko and is currently in the same school as Naoka Ueno, who also bullied Sh\u014dko and weasels back into Sh\u014dya's life.

He also admits his original plan to commit suicide, but has decided against it while asking Sh\u014dko to help him keep living, to which she agrees.\nWhen Sh\u014dya returns to school, he reunites with his friends and realizes how much they still care for him. As they all go to the school festival together, Sh\u014dya tears up, realizing he has finally redeemed himself as he stopped ignoring everyone around him.",
