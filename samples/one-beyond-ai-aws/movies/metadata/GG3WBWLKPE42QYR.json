  "plot": "S\u00e9verine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve), a young and beautiful housewife, is unable to share physical intimacy with her husband, Dr. Pierre Serizy (Jean Sorel), despite their love for each other. Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving domination, sadomasochism, and bondage. Although frustrated by his wife's frigidity toward him, he respects her wishes.\nWhile visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli) and Ren\u00e9e (Macha M\u00e9ril). S\u00e9verine does not like Husson's manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, S\u00e9verine meets up with Ren\u00e9e and learns that a common friend, Henriette, now works at a brothel. At her home, S\u00e9verine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she meets Husson and they discuss Henriette and houses of pleasure. Husson mentions a high-class brothel to S\u00e9verine at 11 Cit\u00e9 Jean de Saumur. He also confesses his desire for her, but S\u00e9verine rejects his advances.\n\nHaunted by childhood memories, including one involving a man who appears to touch her inappropriately, S\u00e9verine goes to the high-class brothel, which is run by Madame Ana\u00efs (Genevi\u00e8ve Page), who names her \"Belle de Jour.\" That afternoon S\u00e9verine services her first client. Reluctant at first, she responds to the \"firm hand\" of Madame Ana\u00efs and has sex with the stranger. After staying away for a week, S\u00e9verine returns to the brothel and begins working from two to five o'clock each day, returning to her unsuspecting husband in the evenings. One day, Husson comes to visit her at home, but S\u00e9verine refuses to see him. Still, she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband's presence. At the same time, S\u00e9verine's physical relationship with her husband is improving and she begins having sex with him.\nS\u00e9verine becomes involved with a young criminal, Marcel (Pierre Cl\u00e9menti), who offers her the kind of thrills and excitement of her fantasies. When Marcel becomes increasingly jealous and demanding, S\u00e9verine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Ana\u00efs's agreement. S\u00e9verine is also concerned about Husson, who has discovered her secret life at the brothel. After one of Marcel's associates follows S\u00e9verine to her home, Marcel visits her and threatens to reveal her secret to her husband. S\u00e9verine pleads with him to leave, which he does, referring to her husband as \"the obstacle\".\nMarcel waits downstairs for Pierre to return home and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees but is shot dead by police. S\u00e9verine's husband survives but is left in a coma. The police are unable to find a motive for the attempted murder. Sometime later S\u00e9verine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now paralysed, blind and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. After Husson leaves, S\u00e9verine returns to see Pierre crying. In an ambiguous ending which is hinted to be another of her fantasies, Pierre then gets out of the wheelchair, pours himself a drink and discusses holiday plans with S\u00e9verine.",
