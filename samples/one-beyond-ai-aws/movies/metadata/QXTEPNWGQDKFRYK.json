  "plot": "The film takes place in Edo in the year 1630. A r\u014dnin called Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d arrives at the estate of the Iyi Clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Sait\u014d Kageyu, the daimy\u014d's senior counselor, tells Hanshir\u014d the story of another r\u014dnin, Chijiiwa Motome\u2014formerly of the same clan as Hanshir\u014d.\nSait\u014d scornfully recalls the practice of r\u014dnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, but in fact  hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshir\u014d. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan\u2014Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro\u2014persuaded Sait\u014d to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome's swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\nDespite this warning, Hanshir\u014d insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshir\u014d is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Sait\u014d and the Iyi retainers, Hanshir\u014d successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro \u2014 the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\nWhile waiting for the messengers to return, Hanshir\u014d recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Sh\u014dgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshir\u014d planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshir\u014d's closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshir\u014d responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshir\u014d rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshir\u014d arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\nWhen Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome's mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshir\u014d with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshir\u014d explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshir\u014d asks Sait\u014d if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Sait\u014d does so, he will die without saying another word. Sait\u014d refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\nAfter provoking Sait\u014d's laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshir\u014d reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshir\u014d's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshir\u014d removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan's honor and bushido itself, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome\u2019s request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked, but they were too preoccupied with their supposed honor to care.\nHaving badly lost face, an enraged Sait\u014d calls Hanshir\u014d a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshir\u014d kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshir\u014d and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshir\u014d commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved r\u014dnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Sait\u014d announces that all deaths caused by Hanshir\u014d shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Sait\u014d angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke are to be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths shall be also attributed to \u201cillness\u201d.\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshir\u014d is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Sh\u014dgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshir\u014d. At the end of his letter, the Sh\u014dgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan's estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.",
