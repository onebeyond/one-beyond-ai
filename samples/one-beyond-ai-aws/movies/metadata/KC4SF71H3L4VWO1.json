  "plot": "In 1970, Cleodegaria \"Cleo\" Guti\u00e9rrez is a Mixtec live-in maid in an upper-middle-class household in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. The household consists of the mother Sof\u00eda; the father Antonio; their four school-aged children (Pepe, Sofi, To\u00f1o, and Paco); and Sof\u00eda's elderly mother, Teresa. Antonio, a doctor, often leaves for business conferences, but Sof\u00eda's distressed reactions to his absences suggest he is actually having an affair. \nMeanwhile, Cleo believes she might be pregnant. She tells her boyfriend, Ferm\u00edn, who pretends to be supportive but then abandons her at a movie theatre. She nervously reveals her news to Sof\u00eda, who provides emotional comfort and takes her to the hospital, confirming her pregnancy. Sof\u00eda then takes Cleo and the children to a family friend's hacienda for New Year celebrations. Recent tensions over land in the area arise, and a large forest fire erupts that the party-goers help extinguish. \nReturning to the city, Cleo passes Antonio and a young woman flirting on the street. Cleo decides to look for Ferm\u00edn, eventually traveling to an impoverished rural region, where she discovers him training at a military-style camp run by Professor Zovek. Ferm\u00edn refuses to acknowledge that the baby is his, threatening to beat Cleo and their child if she talks to him again.\n\nCleo returns to the city, and the increasingly unhinged Sof\u00eda tries unsuccessfully to conceal her husband's infidelity from their children. With the baby almost due, Teresa takes Cleo shopping for a crib downtown. Suddenly, a student protest outside the store turns into a massacre as a paramilitary group, Los Halcones (The Hawks), attacks the protestors. The militants chase a student into the store and murder him. Ferm\u00edn, appearing as one of Los Halcones, points a gun at Cleo and Teresa before wordlessly exiting. Stressed, Cleo's water breaks. The violence in the streets slows traffic and her attempt to get to the hospital. When she arrives at last, Antonio briefly appears to reassure Cleo but makes an excuse to leave. She cries in agony as her baby girl is delivered stillborn.\nLater, Sof\u00eda takes Cleo and the children on a family holiday to the beaches at Tuxpan. Finally, Sof\u00eda reveals to her children that she and their father are separating and that the holiday is giving Antonio time to collect his belongings from their home. At the beach, Sofi and Paco are almost carried off by a strong current, but Cleo wades in and saves them, despite not knowing how to swim. Sof\u00eda and the children affirm their love for Cleo, all of them holding each other and crying, while Cleo confesses that she did not want her baby to be born. The group returns home to find the house reorganized, and Cleo prepares a load of clothes for washing.",
