  "plot": "Charlie, a recluse living with morbid obesity, teaches online English writing courses to college students, but keeps his webcam off, ashamed of his physical appearance. His nurse and only friend, Liz, repeatedly urges him to visit a hospital for congestive heart failure treatment, but Charlie insists he cannot afford medical care. Charlie is also visited by Thomas, a missionary for the New Life Church who wants to save him. He orders pizza almost every night, following an established routine with delivery driver Dan, who drops off the pizza and collects cash payment from the mailbox without the two ever interacting face-to-face.\nCharlie hopes to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter Ellie, whom he abandoned eight years ago when leaving his wife Mary to be with his lover Alan. He reveals that he's been saving money for years, and offers Ellie the entire $120,000 in his bank account if she spends time with him without her mother's knowledge. Ellie agrees on the condition that he completes all her homework for her, though he also requests that she write in a notebook he gives her. \nAs Charlie's health rapidly declines, Liz brings him a wheelchair so he can remain mobile. Liz is disgruntled by Thomas' visits and chastises him. She reveals she is the adopted daughter of New Life's head pastor and that Alan was her brother; his religious guilt drove him to suicide, leading a grief-stricken Charlie to start uncontrollably binge-eating. Despite Liz's objections, Thomas still believes his mission is to help Charlie.\nOne day, Ellie places crushed Ambien into Charlie's food, knocking him out. Thomas arrives and the two smoke marijuana, whereupon Thomas confesses to stealing his youth group's money and running away from home because he felt unfulfilled. Ellie secretly records their conversation.\nOut of concern, Liz brings Mary, Charlie's ex-wife and Ellie's mother, to visit. When Liz learns about the amount Charlie has saved and plans to leave Ellie, she storms out, furious over being lied to about why he avoided medical treatment. Mary and Charlie argue over his decision to leave his family for Alan. Charlie admits he hopes that Ellie will prove he did \"one thing right with his life\". Later that night, while delivering pizza, Dan sees Charlie for the first time and silently runs off in shock. As a result, Charlie has a severe binge-eating episode and sends a profanity-laden email to his students, telling them to disregard the classwork and just write back \"something honest\". \nThomas visits Charlie one last time to inform him that he is moving back home after Ellie sends his confession to his former youth group and family, who have forgiven him and implored him to return. He attempts to preach to Charlie, but Charlie chastises him when he attributes Alan's death to his sexual orientation.\nDuring his next class, Charlie tells his students that he is being fired after the email he sent, and reads some of their submissions. To reciprocate their honesty, he switches on his webcam for the first time, and the students have mixed reactions. Charlie calmly proclaims that academics don't matter, but the honest things his students wrote do, before abruptly ending the class by tossing his laptop against the fridge, destroying it.\nLiz returns and comforts Charlie as his health worsens. Ellie arrives to furiously confront him over an essay he agreed to rewrite for her; Charlie instead replaces it with an essay about Moby-Dick she wrote in eighth grade, as he considers it the most honest essay he has ever read. Ellie initially rebukes him as he attempts to reconcile one final time, though she reads the essay aloud at Charlie's insistence. \nCharlie stands up and begins to walk toward her without assistance, which he had tried but failed to do during her first visit. As she finishes reading, they smile at each other, and Charlie begins to float as he is engulfed in a bright white light.",
