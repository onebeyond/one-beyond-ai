  "plot": "In 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (Bethany Whitmore) lives a lonely life in Mount Waverley, \nVictoria, Australia. She is teased by her classmates because of a birthmark on her forehead. Her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened condensed milk; and a Smurfs-like cartoon show called The Noblets. While at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a New York City telephone book and decides to write to an American. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz from the phone book and sends him a letter telling him about herself.\nMax Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese 44-year-old Jewish atheist who has trouble forming relationships due to various mental and social problems. Mary's letter initially gives him an anxiety attack, but he writes back, and the two become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and The Noblets). Vera disapproves of Max, so Mary tells him to send his letters to her agoraphobic neighbour, Len Hislop. Mary asks Max about love and he suffers a severe anxiety attack, being institutionalised for eight months. He wins the New York Lottery and buys a lifetime supply of chocolate and the entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the remainder to his elderly neighbour, Ivy, who pampers herself before dying in an accident. Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.\nMax finally writes back to Mary explaining he has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires, he takes up metal detecting and is swept away by a large tidal bore while on a beach. The now-adult Mary (Toni Collette) goes to the University of Melbourne. She has her birthmark removed, and develops a crush on her neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos (Eric Bana). Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks embalming fluid instead of cooking sherry. Mary and Damien later marry.\nMary studies psychology and writes her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her case study. She sends Max a copy, and he is infuriated, believing that she has taken advantage of him. He breaks off communication with Mary by removing the letter \"M\" from his typewriter. Mary has the entire run of her book pulped, ending her career. She becomes depressed and begins drinking. She finds a can of condensed milk and sends it to Max as an apology. She finds a letter from Damien informing her that he has left her for his own pen-pal, Desmond.\nAfter he nearly chokes a homeless man (Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum) in anger, Max realizes everyone is imperfect like himself. He sends her his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary fails to find the box on her doorstep for several days. Unaware she is pregnant, Mary decides to commit suicide. Having finally conquered his agoraphobia, Len alerts her of Max's package. A letter from Max tells her of his realisation that they are not perfect. He also states how much their friendship means to him and hopes their paths will cross one day.\nMary travels to New York with her infant child to visit Max. Mary discovers Max dead on his couch, gazing upward and smiling. Mary finds all the letters she had sent to Max over the years taped to the ceiling. Seeing how much Max valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy as she sits beside him on the couch.",
