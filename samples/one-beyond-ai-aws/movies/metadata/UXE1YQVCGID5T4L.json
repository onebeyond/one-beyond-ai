  "plot": "Wild Tales is composed of six short segments: \"Pasternak\", \"Las ratas\" (\"The Rats\"), \"El m\u00e1s fuerte\" (\"The Strongest\"), \"Bombita\" (\"Little Bomb\"), \"La propuesta\" (\"The Proposal\"), and \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" (\"Till Death Do Us Part\"). In the American localisation, the third and fifth sections had their names changed to \"Road to Hell\" and \"The Bill\".\n\n\"Pasternak\"\nTwo passengers on an airplane start a conversation and discover they both know a man named Gabriel Pasternak; the woman (Mar\u00eda Marull), his ex-girlfriend, had sex with his only friend and the man (Dar\u00edo Grandinetti), a music critic, savagely reviewed Pasternak's work. In fact, everyone on the flight is connected to Pasternak. A flight attendant reveals Pasternak is the plane's cabin chief and has locked himself inside the cockpit. Amid the panic, as Pasternak's former psychiatrist tries to reason with him, Pasternak crashes the airplane into his parents' house.\n\n\"Las ratas\"\nAt a highway restaurant, a waitress (Julieta Zylberberg) recognizes a loan shark (C\u00e9sar Bord\u00f3n) who had, years before, ruined her family and caused her father's untimely death. The cook (Rita Cortese) offers to mix rat poison into the man's food. The waitress refuses the offer but unbeknown to her, the cook adds the poison anyway. When the waitress finds out, she does not take the food away from the man. The loan shark's teenage son arrives and begins to share his father's meal. Worried the boy might eat the poison, the waitress tries to remove the plate; she throws food in the man's face and he attacks her. The cook kills the loan shark with a chef's knife. In the last scene, the loan shark's son is getting medical treatment from a responding ambulance while the waitress sits next to him. The cook is arrested and is driven away in a police car.\n\n\"El m\u00e1s fuerte\"\nDiego (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is driving through a desert and tries to overtake a slower, older car that consistently blocks his path. When he finally passes, he insults the other driver, Mario (Walter Donado). Further up the road, Diego gets a flat tire while Mario catches up. Mario parks his car in front of Diego's, smashes Diego's windshield, and then defecates and urinates on it. When Mario is about to leave, Diego pushes him and his car into the river, and drives off. Fearing retribution, Diego returns to run down Mario but loses control and crashes into the river. Mario enters Diego's car and the men start to fight. Mario leaves Diego to be strangled by a seat belt; he then rips off a piece of his shirt, sets fire to it, and places it in the gas tank to incinerate the car, but Diego prevents him from escaping. As the car explodes, the tow truck driver called by Diego arrives. The police later discover the two men's charred bodies holding onto each other and mistake them for lovers who died in a crime of passion.\n\n\"Bombita\"\n\n\nRicardo Dar\u00edn (top), who plays the title character in \"Bombita\", and Oscar Mart\u00ednez (bottom), who appears in the fifth segment, were given the opportunity to choose the role they wanted for the film because Szifron wanted to work with them.[7]\nSim\u00f3n Fischer (Ricardo Dar\u00edn), a demolition expert, picks up a cake for his daughter's birthday party and discovers his car has been towed. He goes to the towed-car lot and explains there were no signs of a no-parking zone. He grudgingly pays the towing fee and misses his daughter's party. The next day, when Sim\u00f3n is refused a refund for the fee at the DMV, he attacks a glass partition and is arrested. The story makes the news and Sim\u00f3n's employer fires him, and his wife (Nancy Dupl\u00e1a) seeks a divorce and sole custody of their daughter. After Fischer unsuccessfully applies for another job, he discovers his car has again been towed. He retrieves the car, packs it with explosives, and parks it in a tow zone. After it is towed again, he detonates the explosives, destroying the towing office with no casualties. Sim\u00f3n is imprisoned and becomes a local hero, earning the nickname \"Bombita\" (\"Little bomb\"), and calls on social media for his release. Sim\u00f3n's wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday, presenting him with a cake in the form of a tow truck.\n\n\"La propuesta\"\nA teenager, driving his wealthy father's car, arrives home after running into a pregnant woman and driving away thereby committing a felony hit-and-run. On the local news, the woman and her child are reported dead, and her husband swears vengeance. The teenage driver's parents (Oscar Mart\u00ednez and Mar\u00eda Onetto) form a plan with his lawyer (Osmar N\u00fa\u00f1ez) to use the parent's groundskeeper Jos\u00e9 (Germ\u00e1n de Silva) as a scapegoat in exchange for half a million dollars. The local prosecutor (Diego Vel\u00e1zquez), however, sees through the scheme. The lawyer negotiates to include the prosecutor in the deal for more money, but the guilty son says he wants to confess to the crowd that has gathered outside the house. Frustrated, the father calls off the deal, telling his son to confess. The lawyer renegotiates, still blaming Jos\u00e9, but now for a lower price. As Jos\u00e9 is taken away by the police, the dead woman's husband repeatedly strikes him on the head with a hammer.\n\n\"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\"\nAt a Jewish wedding[8] reception, the bride Romina (\u00c9rica Rivas) discovers her groom Ariel (Diego Gentile) has had sex with one of the guests. Romina confronts Ariel as they dance in front of everyone, and in distress, Romina runs to the roof, where a kitchen worker comforts her. Ariel discovers Romina having sex with the worker; she tells Ariel she will sleep with every man who shows her interest, and will take everything Ariel owns if he tries to divorce her, or when he dies. The couple return to the reception and continue the festivities. Romina pulls the woman with whom Ariel had sex onto the dance floor, spins her around, and slams her into a mirror. Romina orders the photographer to film Ariel and his mother weeping, declaring she will show the video at a future wedding. Ariel's mother attacks Romina but Ariel and Romina's father pull her off, and Romina collapses with emotion. Ariel approaches Romina and extends a hand. They dance, kiss, and begin to have sex as the guests leave.",
