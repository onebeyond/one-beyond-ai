  "plot": "During the British Raj in 1920, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, an artistically talented young girl from the Gond tribe. Enraged, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of Hyderabad gets sympathetic to the Raj and warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer to quell the threat.  Raju and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence.\nBheem's gullible aide Lachhu believes Raju's ruse, where he attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot. Before taking Raju to Bheem, Lachhu discovers Raju's identity and flees. Shortly after, Bheem and Raju encounter each other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. While working together to save a boy from a train wreck, they form a friendship, gradually growing close. Raju assists Bheem in courting Scott's niece Jenny, unaware that Bheem's agenda is to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is held captive and promises to free her. Raju locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu captures and sets a banded krait onto Raju; it attacks him; he then warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.\nDazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. However, Bheem himself divulges his tribal identity and his mission, unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event to honor Scott, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, creating havoc among the guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly gain the upper hand; however, Raju arrives and they fight briefly but Bheem is forced to give up when Scott threatens to kill Malli. Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is guilt-stricken over his actions, recalling his pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police; he sought a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village to fulfill a promise made to his dying revolutionary father Alluri Venkatarama Raju.\nAt Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally recognizes his reckless actions. Determined to save Bheem, Raju persuades Scott to execute Bheem in secrecy, while preparing an ambush to rescue him. However, Scott figures out the scheme. While rescuing Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who freed himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him and escapes with her, leading to Raju's capture. Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Raju's fianc\u00e9e Sita, repels them by claiming there is a smallpox epidemic.\nUnaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his folly, Bheem vows to save him. With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine and a spear. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks are destroyed. The subsequent explosion kills many soldiers and Catherine. Cornering a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with Jenny and his family. To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.",
