  "plot": "Singer Cl\u00e9o Victoire is having a tarot card reading with a fortune teller, who tells her there is an evil force in Cl\u00e9o's life, and that she sees a doctor with a hazardous task. She also sees a meeting with a talkative young man in her future. The fortune teller then pulls the hanged man card, meaning that a change to the worse in Cl\u00e9o's life is about to happen, and asks if she is ill, which Cl\u00e9o affirms. She then proceeds to pull the death card. Although the fortune teller emphasises that the death card can also simply mean a profound change in the person's life, Cl\u00e9o believes that she is doomed. She asks the fortune teller to read her palm, who rejects her request.\nWhile distraught from her visit to the fortune teller, Cl\u00e9o meets her maid, Ang\u00e8le, at a caf\u00e9 and recounts the results of the tarot card reading, claiming that if it's cancer, she'll kill herself. Cl\u00e9o cries and the owner of the caf\u00e9 gives her coffee to calm down. Cl\u00e9o and Ang\u00e8le proceed to go hat shopping, where Cl\u00e9o buys a black fur hat, despite Ang\u00e8le constantly reminding her that it's summertime. Cl\u00e9o wants to wear the hat home, but Ang\u00e8le reminds her that it's Tuesday, and it's bad luck to wear something new on a Tuesday. They have the shopkeeper send the hat to Cl\u00e9o's home, and Cl\u00e9o and Ang\u00e8le take a taxi home in time for Cl\u00e9o's rehearsal.\nOn the ride home, one of Cl\u00e9o's songs plays, and they listen to the radio, hearing current news coverage including the Algerian War. They have a conversation with the female taxi driver as she muses about the dangers of her job. Towards the end of the taxi ride, Cl\u00e9o grows nauseous and attributes it to her illness. Upon returning home, Cl\u00e9o cannot breathe, and Ang\u00e8le tells her to do some exercise. Before Cl\u00e9o's lover, the man whom the fortune teller mentioned earlier, enters the building, Ang\u00e8le tells Cl\u00e9o not to tell him that she's ill, because \"men hate illness\". Her lover, a very busy man, tells her that he only has time to stop by for a kiss and can't even go on a vacation with her, but will try to take her out on Friday. Asking Cl\u00e9o if she is ill, she replies that she is, but he doesn't take her seriously.\nOnce Cl\u00e9o's lover leaves, Bob, a pianist, and Maurice, a writer, arrive at her home for her rehearsal. Bob and Maurice perform a spontaneous comedy routine pretending to be doctors once Ang\u00e8le tells them that Cl\u00e9o is ill, because \"all women like a good joke.\" However, Cl\u00e9o does not find their joke funny. Bob goes to the piano, and they begin to practice some of Cl\u00e9o's songs. As they practice, Cl\u00e9o's mood quickly darkens after singing the song \"Sans toi.\" Cl\u00e9o feels like all people do is exploit her and that it won't be long until she's just a puppet for the music industry. Saying that everyone spoils her but no one loves her, Cl\u00e9o leaves everyone behind in her home.\nOn the way to a caf\u00e9, Cl\u00e9o passes a street performer swallowing frogs and spitting them back out on a huge wave of water. She plays one of her songs at a jukebox in the caf\u00e9 and watches if the people around react to it, but no one does. She then goes to a sculpting studio to visit her old friend Doroth\u00e9e, who is modelling nude for a class of sculptors. After the modelling session is over, Cl\u00e9o tells Doroth\u00e9e that she couldn't pose nude because she would feel exposed, while Doroth\u00e9e claims that her body makes her happy, not proud. Doroth\u00e9e picks up a package for her friend Raoul who lent her his car to take it to the cinema where he's working. On the way, Cl\u00e9o tells Doroth\u00e9e that she is waiting for a test result and afraid of being terminally ill. At the cinema, they watch a silent comedy film from the projection booth, starring Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina. In the film, Karina topples over a hose pipe and dies, leaving behind a grieving Godard, but after he takes off his sunglasses, realising that it was only his dark glasses which made the events appear so gloomily, the scene repeats in a much lighter tone. Leaving the cinema, Cl\u00e9o accidentally breaks a mirror, which she claims is a bad omen. Together with Doroth\u00e9e she passes the caf\u00e9 that she visited earlier, learning that a man was killed there. They enter a taxi, and Doroth\u00e9e tells her that the broken mirror was meant for that man, not Cl\u00e9o.\nAfter having dropped Doroth\u00e9e off, Cl\u00e9o has the taxi driver take her to Parc Montsouris. In the park, Antoine, a soldier on leave from the Algerian War, addresses Cl\u00e9o and tells her that today is the longest day of the year. During their conversation, Cl\u00e9o tells him that her real name is Florence, and that she's afraid of her illness, while the sensitive Antoine reflects on the war, where people die for nothing, and that this scares him. He asks her to accompany him to the train station to return to the war if he accompanies her to the hospital to get her test results. At the hospital, the doctor whom Cl\u00e9o had her appointment with for her results has already left. While sitting on a bench outside, the doctor rolls by in his car and tells Cl\u00e9o that her condition is not too serious and that two months of radiotherapy will help her to get better. Cl\u00e9o says that her fear seems to be gone, and she seems happy. Antoine says that he hates to leave, and that he would like to be with Cl\u00e9o. She tells him that he is with her at this moment, and they smile at each other.",
