  "plot": "At a modern-day nursing home, the elderly Duke reads a romantic story from a notebook to a female patient:\nIn 1940, at a carnival in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun sees 17-year-old heiress Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton, who is there for the summer with her parents. He pursues her and they begin a romance.\nOne night, Allie meets Noah's father, Frank Calhoun, who immediately likes her. However, when Noah meets her parents, they disapprove. That night, Noah takes Allie to the abandoned Windsor Plantation, telling her he will buy and restore it. As the sun sets, they start to make love for the first time. They are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin, who warns them Allie's parents sent the police out looking for her.\nWhen Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, Allie's mother Anne makes it clear they are against the relationship and forbid her from seeing him. Noah leaves and Allie follows, they argue and she impulsively breaks up with him, and immediately regrets it.\nThe next morning, Anne announces they will be returning home to Charleston immediately. Allie tries to find Noah to apologize but is unsuccessful, so asks Fin to tell him she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's when he gets the message but finds the gates locked.\nNoah writes Allie every day for a year, but Allie's mother secretly intercepts the letters. When all 365 letters go unanswered, he stops writing and decides to move on. He and Fin enlist in the war and fight in the Battle of the Bulge where Fin is killed. Allie nurses in a hospital for wounded soldiers, meeting Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. After a few years, they become engaged, to Allie's parents' delight.\nNoah returns from the war to find that his father had sold their home so Noah can buy The Windsor Plantation. He convinces himself that if he restores it, Allie will come back to him. Once completing it, Noah resists selling it to anyone. As Allie tries on her wedding dress, she sees a newspaper photo of Noah standing in front of the renovated house and faints.\nAllie's feelings for Noah come rushing back, so she asks Lon to take a solo trip before the wedding. Returning to Seabrook, she finds Noah living in their dream house. They rekindle and consummate their relationship. Noah tells Allie about the 365 letters and they realize, because of her mother's intentional secrecy, she never got them.\nDays later, Anne appears to warn Allie that Lon has come to Seabrook. She also reveals that like her daughter, she once loved a lower-class young man in Seabrook and still wonders how changed their lives would have been if she had chosen differently. She gives Allie Noah's letters, telling her she hopes she chooses wisely.\nNoah and Allie argue and he tells her to decide what she wants, as opposed to what her parents or Lon wants. She drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused, and confesses her infidelity to Lon. Although he still wants her back, she follows her heart and returns to Noah.\nIn the present, the elderly woman is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from dementia. Duke is revealed to be Noah, who uses a pseudonym to not startle her in her disoriented state. The journal he reads to her she wrote during the early stages of her illness, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her come back to him. Noah has kept the promise to read it to her almost daily.\nAlmost at the end of the journal story in the notebook, Allie asks Noah what happened at the end of the story and Noah prompts her that she knows what happen. Allie briefly recognizes him and remembers. She asks how long they have before she forgets again and Duke tells her possibly five minutes. They dance to their song, \"I'll Be Seeing You\", and she asks about their kids.\nHowever, Allie's dementia quickly relapses and she panics to see a stranger touching her. She is sedated to control her hysteria. Duke has a heart attack and is treated in the nursing home while Allie is taken to the dementia ward. Upon recovering and despite not being permitted, Duke sneaks into Allie's room in the night. She instantly recognizes him, they kiss, and fall asleep holding hands. The nurse finds them in the morning still holding hands as they both died peacefully in their sleep.",
