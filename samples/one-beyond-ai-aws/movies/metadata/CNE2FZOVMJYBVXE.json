  "plot": "Part One: The Departure (November 1957)\nMadame \u00c9mery and her beautiful 17-year-old daughter Genevi\u00e8ve have a tiny, struggling umbrella boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg in Normandy. Guy is a handsome young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother \u00c9lise. Though Genevi\u00e8ve's mother disapproves, Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve are deeply in love; they plan to marry and name their first child Fran\u00e7oise. At the same time, Madeleine, a quiet young woman who looks after Guy's aunt, is secretly in love with Guy.\n\nGuy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War. The night before he leaves, he and Genevi\u00e8ve pledge their undying love and make love, presumably for the first time.\n\nPart Two: The Absence (January\u2013April 1958)\nGenevi\u00e8ve learns she is pregnant and writes to Guy, but his replies are sporadic. Her mother tells her to give up on Guy \u2013 he has forgotten her. Genevi\u00e8ve is courted by Roland Cassard, a kind, young, very wealthy Parisian jeweler; he wants to marry her despite her pregnancy. In one of the connections among Demy's trilogy of films, Roland had previously unsuccessfully wooed the title character in the earlier Lola (1961); now he relates a version of this story to Madame \u00c9mery. Madame \u00c9mery urges Genevi\u00e8ve to be sensible and choose a secure future with Roland. Roland announces that he will be going to Amsterdam for three months, and will wait for Genevi\u00e8ve's answer until his return. Genevi\u00e8ve marries Roland in a great cathedral, but she appears ambivalent about her decision.\n\nPart Three: The Return (March 1959 \u2013 December 1963)\nReturning injured from the war, Guy learns that Genevi\u00e8ve has married and left Cherbourg. He has a difficult time readjusting to civilian life. After an argument with his boss he quits his job, goes drinking in a seedy bar, and spends the night with a prostitute. When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him that his aunt \u00c9lise has died.\n\nGuy sees that Madeleine loves him, and he rebuilds his life with her help. Using the inheritance from his aunt he opens a new \"American-style\" gas station. Madeleine agrees to marry him, though she wonders whether he is merely on the rebound after losing Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFour years later, on a snowy Christmas Eve, Guy and Madeleine are in the office of their gas station with their small son Fran\u00e7ois. As Madeleine and Fran\u00e7ois leave to visit Santa Claus, a car pulls in. The mink-clad driver is Genevi\u00e8ve, now wealthy and sophisticated. She has a young girl with her, their daughter Fran\u00e7oise.\n\nGuy invites Genevi\u00e8ve into the warmth of the station's office, where they chat as a boy attends to Genevi\u00e8ve's car. Genevi\u00e8ve reveals this is her first time in Cherbourg since her marriage, and tells Guy that her mother died recently. When asked if he wants to meet his daughter, Guy declines.\n\nOnce the car is ready Genevi\u00e8ve and Guy finish their conversation. On her way out, Genevi\u00e8ve opens the door and pulls her collar tight against the cold before looking back at Guy one last time. She walks to her car and drives off. Madeleine returns with Fran\u00e7ois, and Guy greets her with a kiss. As the camera pulls back, he frolics with his son in the snow, then picks him up and follows Madeleine inside as the red light of Genevieve's car flash in the foreground.",
