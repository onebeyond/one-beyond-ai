Upon his return home one day, Midori tells him that the hospital where Keita was born urgently needs to speak to them, and Ry\u014dta senses trouble. After arriving at the hospital, the couple learn that their biological son Ry\u016bsei was switched with Keita at birth, and after DNA tests prove the error, they must now make a life-changing decision to either keep Keita, the boy they raised as their own son, or exchange him for their biological son.\nRy\u014dta and Midori soon meet with the other couple, Yukari and Y\u016bdai Saiki, small-town folks who lack the money and drive that Ry\u014dta possesses, but who have a better understanding of the importance of child and parent bonds. They share photos, and for the first time, Ry\u014dta and Midori see their biological son, Ry\u016bsei. After several meetings, they decide to exchange children for one Saturday. After several more meetings, they finally decide to exchange children permanently. All four parents have difficulty accepting the loss of their previous sons, and the absence of the parents they used to know causes both boys to shut down emotionally, culminating in Ry\u016bsei running away from the Nonomiyas' home and returning to the Saikis'. Ry\u014dta picks up Ry\u016bsei and brings him back home.\nRy\u014dta and Midori begin to bond with Ry\u016bsei, who is also warming up to them. However, while going through the photos on his camera, Ry\u014dta discovers a cache of photos of himself, mostly sleeping, that Keita took, and he breaks down crying. The three return to the Saiki family, but Keita runs away from Ry\u014dta. While following him, Ry\u014dta apologizes to Keita, and the two make amends. The film ends with the two returning to the Saikis', and both families entering the home.",
