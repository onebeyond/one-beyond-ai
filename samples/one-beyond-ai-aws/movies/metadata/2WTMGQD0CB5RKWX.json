  "plot": "On the morning of September 11, 2001, four al-Qaeda members, Ziad Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami, and Ahmed al-Haznawi pray in a Newark, New Jersey hotel, and drive to Newark International Airport to board United Airlines Flight 93, piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer LeRoy Homer Jr., bound for San Francisco. Among the passengers are Tom Burnett, Todd Beamer, Jeremy Glick,  Richard Guadagno, Louis J. Nacke II and Lauren Grandcolas. During boarding, Jarrah makes a final phone call to his girlfriend, and Mark Bingham, rushing to the aisle, is the last passenger to board, barely making the flight. Air traffic controllers lose contact with American Airlines Flight 11 which diverts toward New York City while United 93 is delayed due to heavy air traffic. ATCs realize Flight 11 has been hijacked after hearing suspicious transmissions. United 93 is cleared for take off and passes New York, Jarrah looking at the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Shortly after, Flight 11 crashes into the Trade Centre's North Tower, and United Airlines Flight 175 is also hijacked and heads toward New York. ATCs watch in horror as United 175 crashes into the South Tower. They learn that American Airlines Flight 77 has also been hijacked.\nAs United 93 reaches its cruising altitude, and the passengers are served breakfast, Jarrah hesitates to give the signal to start the hijacking. An ACARS message is sent from Homer's wife, asking if he is all right. An ACARS warning notifies the pilots of the WTC attacks and to beware cockpit intrusion. After Nami unsuccessfully urges Jarrah to attack, an impatient Haznawi prepares an artificial bomb in the lavatory. Ghamdi grabs flight attendant Deborah Welsh at knifepoint and passenger Mark Rothenberg is mortally wounded by Haznawi. As Haznawi and Nami force the passengers to the back of the plane, Ghamdi fatally stabs both pilots, but not in time to prevent them sending out a mayday call, and kills Welsh, as Jarrah takes the controls. Grandcolas (an emergency medical technician) tries to help the dying Rothenberg as the hijackers jubilantly react to the text message indicating the success of the WTC attack. Nami berates Grandcolas and sends her back. Jarrah redirects the plane towards Washington, D.C., with the intention to crash the plane into the United States Capitol, as flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles unsuccessfully attempt to revive Rothenberg. Bradshaw sees the hijackers moving the pilots and Welsh's bodies and the passengers overhear this.\nFlight 77 crashes into the Pentagon, and FAA National Operations Manager Ben Sliney decides to shut down all U.S. air space and ground all flights. On United 93, passengers learn of the other attacks from family members via airphone. Realizing the hijackers have no intention of landing and are on a suicide mission, Burnett, Bingham, Beamer, Glick (a former judo champion), Guadagno, Nacke, Grandcolas, passengers William Cashman, Patrick Driscoll and Alan Beaven form a plan to retake the plane, with assistance from Bradshaw, Lyles and the flight staff, arming themselves with weapons, and learn passenger Donald Greene is a licensed pilot and passenger Andrew Garcia is a former air traffic controller. As the group gather, Haznawi and Nami anxiously realize they are losing control and Jarrah and Ghamdi get agitated, as they are twenty minutes away from D.C. and are unable to speed up to reach their target. Passenger Christian Adams, attempting to counsel appeasement, is restrained by the passengers. The passengers pray and make final calls to loved ones.\nAfter Beamer urges the group to take action, stating, \"Let's Roll,\", the passengers charge a stunned Haznawi, tackle him and beat him. As Nami, Ghamdi and Jarrah panic, Haznawi is killed by Bingham bashing his skull in with a fire extinguisher and Nacke declares the bomb a fake. Jarrah violently rocks the plane to disrupt the passenger assault as Nami attempts to keep them at bay with a serving cart, Mace and a fire extinguisher, but the passengers subdue him. Nami is killed when Glick gouges his eyes out before snapping his neck. The two remaining hijackers are disheartened by the realization that their mission to strike the Capitol Building has failed, as the passengers batter the cockpit door with the cart. Despite Ghamdi's efforts to hold against the door with an axe, the passengers successfully weaken the door enough to tear it off its hinges. Jarrah puts the aircraft into a steep dive, just as the passengers break the door and storm the cockpit. Ghamdi tries to protect Jarrah, but the passengers overpower him and wrestle Jarrah for control. United 93 inverts and plummets into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all aboard. An epilogue text states that United 93 was the only plane not to reach its intended target.",
