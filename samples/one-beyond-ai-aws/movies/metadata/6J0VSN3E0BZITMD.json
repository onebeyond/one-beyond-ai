  "plot": "The film follows a non-linear narrative, going back and forth from the present, where Sardar Udham Singh is in London, to his past when he was part of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and explores his reasons for assassinating Indian Civil Service officer Michael O'Dwyer. Udham (known as Sher Singh) is released from prison at Punjab in British India. He is constantly being watched by the colonial authorities. He leaves India and goes to USSR during what appears to be winter. From there he makes his way to London by ship. Even though the British authorities are on the lookout for him, he successfully evades them and lives in London, making a living as a salesman and then a welder. He is shown in front of Caxton Hall, making his way inside where O'Dwyer is giving a speech on his time as Lt. Governor of Punjab and how he had suppressed a major uprising. Udham makes his way to O'Dwyer and shoots him, and is arrested.\nUdham is appointed a lawyer who slowly gets Udham to tell his backstory. Udham is brought to court and in spite of a good lawyer, the judges sentence him to death. Upon hearing this, Udham makes an impromptu speech where he denounces British rule in India and reaffirms his support for the Indian freedom movement. Udham protests the conditions of his detention and goes on a 42-day fast, but is force-fed to break it. He slowly opens up to the investigating inspector and tells him the reasons for the assassination. Udham also got the title of Shaheed-E-Azam.\nIn 1919, Udham is a young adult working in a textile mill near Amritsar, with a girlfriend who is mute. On 13 April 1919, General Dyer following an order from O'Dwyer, opens fire on a crowd of 20,000 peaceful protestors inside Jallianwala Bagh. Udham is sleeping unaware of the massacre, until his friend wakes him up, mortally wounded and bleeding profusely. He hears about the massacre and rushes to the grounds to help. It is shown that along with a few other volunteers, Udham finds survivors and gets them to a makeshift hospital which is overwhelmed itself. He is later executed and shown to have a photo of Bhagat Singh, taken when Bhagat was in prison during his final days.\nAfter the Independence of India, Udham's ashes are brought to India upon the request of Punjab Chief Minister Giani Zail Singh and were immersed in Sutlej river. His ashes were immersed where his idol Bhagat's ashes were immersed. In the final scene, Gen. Dyer and O'Dwyer give their own accounts to the Hunter Commission.",
