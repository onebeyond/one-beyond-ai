  "plot": "In Edwardian-era London, in the spring of 1910, George Banks returns home, at number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, to learn from his wife, Winifred, that the babysitter, Katie Nanna, has left their service after their children, Jane and Michael, had run away \"for the fourth time this week\" (\"The Life I Lead\"). They are returned home shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals they were chasing after a lost kite. The children ask George to help them build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. In contrast, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny (\"The Perfect Nanny\"). Winifred, who strongly agrees with the children, tries to keep the peace. After ordering Jane and Michael to go to bed, Mr. Banks rips up the letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but a strong wind draws the fragments up through the chimney and into the air.\nThe next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home for Ellen to show them all in, but a strong gust of wind blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young magical nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. After landing at 17 Cherry Tree Lane, she marched inside, and presents herself to Mr. Banks, Mary Poppins calmly produces the children's restored advertisement and agrees with its requests but promises the astonished banker that she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and she convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children and helps them magically tidy their nursery by snapping her fingers, before heading out for a walk in the park (\"Spoonful of Sugar\").\nOutside, they meet Mary's friend Bert, a jack of all trades working as a street painter; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll. Together, they sing (\"Jolly Holiday\"), and Bert flirts with Mary Poppins. After they meet up with the children, Mary Poppins enchants the carousel horses; Bert rescues a fox from a fox hunt; they take part in a horse race, which Mary wins. Describing her victory, Mary Poppins uses a nonsense word (\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"). The outing is ended when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London; upon their return home, Mary forces the children to take medicine to avoid getting sick and puts them into bed, but when Jane and Michael become too excited to go to sleep, Mary calmly sings a lullaby to them to help them go to sleep (\"Stay Awake\").\nThe next day, the three, along with Bert, meet Mary Poppins' odd Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air due to his uncontrollable laughter. They join him for a tea party on the ceiling with lots of jokes (\"I Love to Laugh\"), only to later result in Albert and Bert sobbing uncontrollably as Mary leaves with Jane and Michael.\nAfterward, Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary Poppins, but she persuades him to take the children to his workplace the next day. That evening, Mary sings to the children a hymn-like lullaby about the woman who sits on the steps of the St. Paul's Cathedral selling bird food (\"Feed The Birds\"). \nThe next day at the bank, the children meet the elderly Mr. Dawes Sr., who aggressively urges Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching the coin from Michael (\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\"). Michael demands his coin back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a bank run.\nJane and Michael flee the bank, getting lost in the East End of London until they meet up with Bert again, now working as a chimney sweep, who escorts them home (\"Chim Chim Cheree\"). The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home (\"Step in Time\") after their neighbor Admiral Boom mistakes them for robbers and launches fireworks at them from a cannon. Mr. and Mrs. Banks return home to find Bert's friends dancing in their home, and Mr. Banks sends them away. Mr. Banks then gets a phone call from the bank requesting a meeting with him about what the children did. The children overhear the phone call and realize that their father is in trouble. Bert tells Mr. Banks that he needs to spend more time with his children before they grow up (\"A Man Has Dreams\"). Michael gives George the tuppence, hoping to make amends.\nMr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", tells Uncle Albert's \"Wooden leg named Smith\" joke the children told, and happily heads home. Mr. Dawes Sr. mulls over the joke and, finally understanding it, floats up into the air, laughing.\nThe next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Banks family meets Mr. Dawes Sr.'s son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals his father died laughing from the joke (\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\"). Mr. Dawes Jr. says he had never seen his father happier in his life and re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner. \nMary Poppins watches the family with her umbrella. It comments on how she really feels about the children, but she firmly stops him talking, stating that they should love their father more than her. With her work done, Mary then opens her umbrella, and it carries her away on the wind. Bert notices her umbrella carrying her away, smiles, and tells Mary Poppins not to stay away too long. Clutching her opened umbrella and holding her carpet bag, Mary Poppins flies away in the distance.",
