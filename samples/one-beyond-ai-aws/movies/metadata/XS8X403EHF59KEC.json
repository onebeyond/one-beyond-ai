  "plot": "In 1969, during the Vietnam War, U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz is waging a brutal guerrilla war against NVA and PLAF forces without permission from his commanders. At an outpost in Cambodia, he commands American and Montagnard troops, who see him as a demigod.\nBurnt-out MACV-SOG operative Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to I Field Force headquarters in Nha Trang. He is ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command ... with extreme prejudice\".\nAmbivalent, Willard joins a U.S. Navy river patrol boat (PBR) commanded by Chief Petty Officer Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\" and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment\u2014a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore\u2014to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative, as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's Viet Cong-held coastal mouth. The helicopter squadron, playing \"Ride of the Valkyries\" on loudspeakers, raids at dawn with a napalm strike. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR, while the Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice Kurtz made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join Special Forces, with no prospect of advancing beyond the rank of colonel.\nAt a remote U.S. Army outpost, Willard and Lance seek information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer, Willard orders the Chief to continue. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting enemy fire, causing Mr. Clean's death. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by forcing the spear point at him protruding from his own chest before Willard subdues him. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR.\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, an abandoned Ankor temple teeming with Montagnards and strewn with remains of victims. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American photojournalist, who praises Kurtz's genius. They encounter a near-catatonic Colby. Willard sets out with Lance to find Kurtz, leaving Chef with orders to call in an airstrike on the outpost if the two do not return.\nIn the camp, Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz. Kurtz places Chef's severed head onto Willard's lap, preventing the airstrike. Willard is released and Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, praising the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially kill a water buffalo, Willard kills Kurtz with a machete. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard gathers Lance, boards the PBR, and heads back down river, away from the beaten Montagnards.",
