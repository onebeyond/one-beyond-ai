  "plot": "In rural Belgium, two 13-year-old boys, L\u00e9o and R\u00e9mi, are best friends who exhibit a deeply intimate affection for one another. They have a habit of sleeping in the same bed in R\u00e9mi's bedroom. R\u00e9mi's parents, Sophie and Peter, accept this without judgment and love L\u00e9o like a second child. L\u00e9o's family helps run agricultural work at a flower farm, where he and R\u00e9mi like to play together.\nAt school, a trio of female classmates openly ask if the two are a couple. L\u00e9o vehemently denies it, while R\u00e9mi does not comment. L\u00e9o becomes uneasy with this external perception, exacerbated by homophobic slurs directed towards him by other boys. Fearing being ostracized, he begins new friendships and takes up ice hockey, from which he deliberately excludes R\u00e9mi. One night, while sleeping over at R\u00e9mi's, L\u00e9o decides to sleep on a separate mattress. Upon waking up, he finds R\u00e9mi sleeping on the same mattress as him. L\u00e9o turns aggressive, leaving R\u00e9mi hurt and confused. L\u00e9o becomes progressively distant from R\u00e9mi, despite R\u00e9mi's attempts at interaction. He stops sleeping over, starts riding his bicycle with students other than R\u00e9mi, continues participating in ice hockey, and spends more time working with his family at the farm. R\u00e9mi finally confronts him, to which he acts defensive. Distraught and angry, R\u00e9mi attacks L\u00e9o and the two fight.\nOne day, after a school trip from which R\u00e9mi is absent, the class is informed that R\u00e9mi has committed suicide, which L\u00e9o believes his withdrawal caused. However, he closes off his emotions from everyone else, unable to talk to anyone about it during the class therapy sessions offered by the school. The fact that his classmates describe R\u00e9mi in obituaries as a happy and friendly boy triggers a defiant opposition in L\u00e9o. L\u00e9o unsuccessfully tries to suppress his inner pain and cover it up by resuming ice hockey and gardening work with his family. Although none of his new friendships come close to the deep connection he had with R\u00e9mi, L\u00e9o is able to confide in his older brother Charlie for comfort.\nFollowing R\u00e9mi's funeral, L\u00e9o knows he has to talk to Sophie, wanting to maintain his connection with her, but is anxious to confess. When Sophie and Peter have dinner with L\u00e9o's family, Peter breaks down when Charlie describes his future plans, as Sophie and Peter mourn the loss of R\u00e9mi's future. When summer vacation begins, L\u00e9o visits Sophie at her workplace without warning. As she drives him home, he finally confesses to her that he believes R\u00e9mi's suicide is his fault for pushing him away. After an initial moment of tension, she tenderly hugs and comforts him as they cry together. Sometime later, she and Peter have moved away, leaving the house empty. L\u00e9o walks across the field where he and R\u00e9mi used to run through, remembering their connection and allowing himself to finally grieve for R\u00e9mi.",
