  "plot": "In post-World War II Rome, Antonio Ricci, an unemployed man, is offered work pasting advertising bills. The job requires Antonio to own a bicycle, which is impounded at a mount of piety. His wife Maria is forced to pawn her dowry bedsheets to redeem the bicycle. On Antonio's first day of the job, while he is trying to paste a film poster, his bicycle is stolen. After Antonio unsuccessfully pursues the thief, he reports the theft to the police, but realizes that they will not help with such a small and common theft.\nReturning home embittered, Antonio understands that his only option is to search for the bicycle himself. He asks for help from a political comrade, who in turn mobilizes his waste collector colleagues. At dawn, they and Antonio's son Bruno go to search for the bicycle at markets where stolen goods are often resold. At the Piazza Vittorio market, they find a bicycle frame, but the serial number does not match. At the Porta Portese market, Antonio spots the thief in the company of an old tramp, but the thief eludes him and the tramp feigns ignorance. Antonio follows the tramp into a soup kitchen, but the tramp takes advantage of a distraction and slips away. A hopeless Antonio turns to a supposed \"holy woman\", but her sibylline response is almost a joke.\nImmediately afterward, Antonio encounters the thief by chance in a disreputable district, but the denizens firmly defend the thief and threaten Antonio. A policeman Antonio turns to can do nothing about the culprit, as there is no concrete evidence of his crime. Overwhelmed and fatigued, Antonio and Bruno await a tram ride home. Antonio notices an unattended bicycle and, in desperation, clumsily attempts to steal it, but is immediately stopped and attacked by bystanders. The bicycle's owner, after seeing Bruno's tears, takes pity on Antonio and has him released. Bruno takes Antonio's hand and the two walk away into the crowd as evening descends on Rome.",
