  "plot": "Georgekutty is an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 4th standard. He is now a businessman running a cable television service in a rural area in Rajakkad. He is married to Rani and they have two daughters, Anju, a +2 student, and Anu, a student of 6th class. His only interest apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office.\nDuring a nature camp, Anju gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone. The culprit Varun Prabhakar, is the son of IG Geetha. Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and Anju when he comes to blackmail them using the clip either any one of them should sleep with him or he will surely publish the clip through Internet. They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Anu. Rani tells Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Varun's car, which is seen by a police constable, Sahadevan, who has a grudge against Georgekutty. Georgekutty takes his family on a trip to attend a religious retreat, watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. Geetha, realising that Varun has gone missing starts an investigation.\nAfter a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and his family for questioning. Georgekutty had predicted that this would happen and taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they reply the same thing and they had also shown the bill of the restaurant, the movie's and bus journey's tickets as a proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. Geetha realises that on the day of the incident, Georgekutty had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie.\nGeetha arrests Georgekutty and his family and Sahadevan uses brute force to beat the truth out of them. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a calf, indicating that Georgekutty had moved the body. Georgekutty and Anu reports to the media and complains against Sahadevan, who is later suspended and Geetha resigns from her post. Geetha and her husband Prabhakar meet Georgekutty to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior. Georgekutty suspects there might be foul play involved and still does not reveal directly that his family has committed a crime. Georgekutty, now in remand, signs a register at the newly constructed local police station and leaves.\nAs he exits from the Police Station, it is revealed that Georgekutty had hidden Varun's body in the foundations of the very police station that he is walking out of.",
