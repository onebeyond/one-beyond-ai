  "plot": "In Krak\u00f3w during World War II, the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Krak\u00f3w Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.\nSS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer (second lieutenant) Amon G\u00f6th arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of the P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to P\u0142asz\u00f3w, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. G\u00f6th brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks G\u00f6th for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Br\u00fcnnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. G\u00f6th reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Br\u00fcnnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Br\u00fcnnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated. The Jews then walk to a nearby town.\nAn epilogue reveals that G\u00f6th was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed via hanging, while Schindler's marriage and businesses failed following the war. In the present, many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.",
