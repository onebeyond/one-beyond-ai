  "plot": "Aviator Andr\u00e9 Jurieux lands at Le Bourget Airfield outside Paris after crossing the Atlantic in his plane. He is greeted by his friend Octave, who tells Andr\u00e9 that Christine  \u2013 the Austrian-French noblewoman Andr\u00e9 loves \u2013 has not come to greet him. Andr\u00e9 is heartbroken. When a radio reporter comes to broadcast Andr\u00e9's first words upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces Christine. She is listening to the broadcast in her Paris apartment while attended by her maid, Lisette. Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye for three years. For two years, Lisette has been married to Schumacher  \u2013 the gamekeeper at Robert's country estate, La Colini\u00e8re in Sologne \u2013 but she is more devoted to Christine than to her husband. Christine's past relationship with Andr\u00e9 is openly known by her husband, her maid and their friend Octave. After Christine and Robert playfully discuss Andr\u00e9's emotional display and pledge devotion to one another, Robert excuses himself to make a telephone call. He arranges to meet his mistress Genevi\u00e8ve the next morning.\nAt Genevi\u00e8ve's apartment, Robert says he must end their relationship but invites her to join them for a weekend retreat to La Colini\u00e8re. Christine also invites her niece, Jackie. Later, Octave induces Robert to invite Andr\u00e9 to the estate as well. They joke that Andr\u00e9 and Genevi\u00e8ve will begin a relationship, thereby solving everyone's problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds and trying to eliminate rabbits. Marceau  \u2013 a poacher \u2013 sneaks onto the estate to retrieve a rabbit caught in a snare. Before Marceau can escape, Schumacher catches him and begins to escort him from the property when Robert demands to know what is happening. Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits and Robert hires him as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Lisette. The assembled guests go on a hunt led by Schumacher, who resents Marceau. On the way back to La Colini\u00e8re's castle, Robert tells Genevi\u00e8ve that he no longer loves her. Genevi\u00e8ve wants to pack up and leave but Christine persuades her to stay.\nAt a masked ball, various romantic liaisons are made. Andr\u00e9 and Christine declare their love for each other and plan to run away together. Marceau pursues Lisette, and the jealous Schumacher is upset. Robert and Andr\u00e9 come to an argument over Christine. In the secluded greenhouse, Octave declares that he too loves Christine \u2013 who is now having doubts about Andr\u00e9 \u2013 and they decide to run away together. Schumacher and Marceau, who have both been expelled from the estate by Robert after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse. As in Beaumarchais's Marriage of Figaro, the literary basis for Mozart's opera, they mistake Christine for Lisette because Christine is wearing Lisette's cape and hood. Octave returns to the house for his coat and hat, where Lisette begs him not to leave with Christine.\nBreaking his promise to Christine, Octave meets Andr\u00e9 and sends him out to Christine in the greenhouse, lending him his overcoat. When Andr\u00e9 reaches the greenhouse wearing Octave's coat, Schumacher mistakes him for Octave, whom he thinks is trying to run off with his wife Lisette, and Schumacher shoots him dead.\nIn the closing moments of the film, Octave and Marceau walk away into the night as Robert brings Schumacher back into the household and explains that he would report the killing to the authorities as nothing more than an unfortunate accident.",
