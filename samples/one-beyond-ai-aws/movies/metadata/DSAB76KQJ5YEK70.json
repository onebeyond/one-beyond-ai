  "plot": "In 1939, in Fascist Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Italian Jewish man who arrives to work in the city of Arezzo, in Tuscany, where his uncle Eliseo works in the restaurant of a hotel. Guido is comical and sharp and falls in love with a Gentile girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. \nFinally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise and gives in, against her better judgment. He steals the lady from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married, have a son Giosu\u00e8, and run a bookstore.\nDuring World War II, in 1944 when Northern Italy is occupied by Nazi Germany, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. \nHowever, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido do not see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\nIn the camp, Guido hides the true situation from his son. Guido tells Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. \nAt one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosu\u00e8 that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosu\u00e8 is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosu\u00e8 are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian, effectively providing a ruse.\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders Guido to be executed and Guido is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. \nThe next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu\u00e8 is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosu\u00e8 to ride on the tank. \nWhile traveling to safety, Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosu\u00e8 excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosu\u00e8, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.",
