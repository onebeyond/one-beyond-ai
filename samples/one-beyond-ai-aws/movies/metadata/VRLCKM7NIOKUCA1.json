  "plot": "On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at Shermer High School report for an all-day detention: socially awkward Brian Johnson, volatile wrestler Andrew Clark, shy loner Allison Reynolds, popular snob Claire Standish, and rebellious delinquent John Bender. They gather in the school library, where vice principal Richard Vernon warns them not to talk or move from their seats, and assigns them each a thousand-word essay describing \"who you think you are\".\nJohn ignores the rules and spends his time antagonizing the others and defying Vernon, who gives him eight additional weekends of detention. The students sneak off to retrieve John's marijuana stash from his locker, but when they see Vernon returning to the library, John deliberately gets caught to allow the others to sneak back in. Locked in a storage closet as punishment, John is offered a chance to punch Vernon but fails to act. He soon escapes into the ceiling panels and falls into the library, where the others hide him from Vernon.\nThe students pass the time arguing, listening to music, and smoking marijuana, gradually opening up about their home lives and their reasons for being in detention. Claire's popularity subjects her to intense peer pressure, while her bickering parents use her against each other, and received detention for skipping school to go shopping. John reveals the abuse he and his mother suffer from his father, and is serving detention for pulling a fire alarm. Andrew, intimidated by his father to succeed in sports, was given detention for taping a student's buttocks together in an attempt to win his teammates' \u2014 and his father's \u2014 approval. Brian is under such pressure from his parents to get good grades that he contemplated suicide after getting an F in shop class, and was sent to detention for bringing a flare gun to school to kill himself. Allison is a compulsive liar with neglectful parents, constantly stealing things to use should she ever run away from home, and admits that she showed up to detention for lack of anything better to do.\nDespite their differences, the students realize they all face similar problems; Andrew and Allison bond over their difficult relationships with their parents, and Brian and Claire share the same anxiety over being virgins, although the group suspects that their new friendships will end once detention is over. Meanwhile, Vernon complains to the janitor, Carl, that students have become less disciplined, but Carl suggests that Vernon is the one who has changed and cares too much what his students think of him.\nThe others convince Brian to complete Vernon's essay on the group's behalf. Claire gives Allison a makeover, which sparks romantic interest from Andrew, and John crawls back to the closet, where Claire challenges her \"pristine\" reputation by kissing him. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, and she rips the state championship patch off his letterman jacket to keep; Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, and they share their own kiss.\nVernon reads Brian\u2019s essay, which asserts that the vice principal has made petty assumptions about all of them and declares that \"each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.\" Walking home through the school's football field, John triumphantly raises his fist in the air.",
