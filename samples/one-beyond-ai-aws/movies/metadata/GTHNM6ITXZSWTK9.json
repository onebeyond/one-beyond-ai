  "plot": "Kazuko Yoshiyama, a third-year middle school student, is cleaning the school science lab with her classmates, Kazuo Fukamachi and Gor\u014d Asakura, when she smells a lavender-like scent and faints. After three days, events transpire around Kazuko, including the burning of Gor\u014d's house after an earthquake. The next morning, at the exact moment of a car accident, Kazuko is transported 24 hours into the past.\nShe relives the day and relates her strange experience to Kazuo and Gor\u014d. They do not believe her at first, but they are convinced when she accurately predicts the earthquake and ensuing fire. Goro also almost gets hit by a truck but Kazuko knows and tells him, so it adds to Goro believing her even more. They go to see Fukushima, their science teacher, explains Kazuko's new ability as \"teleportation\" and \"time-leap\". To solve the riddle of her power, she must leap back four days.\nFinally, Kazuko's determination enables her to make the leap. Back in the science room, she meets a mysterious man who has assumed her friend Kazuo's identity. He is really \"Ken Sogoru\", a time-traveler from AD 2660. His intersection with the girl's life is the accidental effect of a \"time-leaping\" drug. Ken remains for a month, and Kazuko falls in love with him. When he leaves, he erases all memories of himself from everyone he has met, including Kazuko. As the book ends, Kazuko has the faint memory of somebody promising to meet her again every time she smells lavender.",
