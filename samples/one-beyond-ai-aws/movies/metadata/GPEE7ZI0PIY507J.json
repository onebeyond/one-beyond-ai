Jennifer runs an unsuccessful caf\u00e9 with her neighbour, Jaswinder \"Jazz\" Kapoor. Lajjo is hostile to Jennifer and Jia as she believes that Jia's adoption led her son (Jennifer's husband and Naina's father) to commit suicide.\nNaina has two best friends: her classmate, Rohit Patel, and Jaspreet \"Sweetu\" Kapoor, Jazz's sister. Her life is dull and overshadowed by the loss of her father until Aman Mathur and his mother move in next door with his uncle, Pritam Chaddha.

Rohit and Naina's wedding, which Aman attends, takes place soon afterwards.\nSometime after the wedding, Aman is on his deathbed and says goodbye to everyone.
