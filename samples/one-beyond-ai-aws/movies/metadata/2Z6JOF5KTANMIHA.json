  "plot": "In occupied Rome in 1944, German SS troops are trying to arrest Luigi Ferraris (hiding under the alias of engineer Giorgio Manfredi), a communist, and leader of the Resistance against the Nazis and Italian Fascists. The landlady of his rooming house warns him in time for him to elude capture. He sneaks to the home of Francesco, another Resistance fighter. There he encounters Pina, Francesco's visibly pregnant fianc\u00e9e, who lives in the next apartment. She first suspects Luigi of being a cop and gives him a rough time, but when he makes it clear he is a confederate of Francesco she welcomes him into his apartment to wait for him. With Pina's help Luigi/Giorgio contacts Don Pietro, a Catholic priest who is helping the Resistance. Luigi asks him to transfer messages and money to a group of Resistance fighters outside the city, as he is now known to the Gestapo and cannot do it himself. The priest willingly does so.\n\nDon Pietro is also scheduled to officiate at Pina's and Francesco's wedding the next day. Francesco is not very religious, but would rather be married by a patriot priest than a fascist official; the devout Pina, on the other hand, is pragmatic about the decision - as it would be unthinkable in normal times for an unmarried pregnant woman to be married in a church - but wrestling with why God would allow such terrible things to happen to people as are occurring all around them. Her son, Marcello, a somewhat reluctant altar boy, is involved with a crippled youth fighting his own resistance planting bombs. Pina's feckless sister Laura stays with her, but works in a cabaret serving the Nazis and Fascists. She is also an old friend of Marina, Luigi's girlfriend, who has been looking for him. Marina also works in the cabaret and has not only turned to prostitution for the luxuries she craves but has become addicted to drugs by the treacherous Ingrid, a consort of the local Nazi commander, Major Bergmann.\nBergmann, helped by the Italian police chief, suspects that Luigi is at Francesco's apartment. They raid the huge building that afternoon, pulling everyone out and arresting dozens of men. Luigi gets away, but Francesco is thrown in a truck to be hauled off. Seeing him, Pina breaks through a cordon of soldiers screaming his name, but is shot dead. The priest, who was in the building to erase any trace of the Resistance weapons under the guise of praying for a dying man, holds her in his arms and prays as Part I ends.\nPart II begins with the several trucks of Italian prisoners taken from the apartment building in a convoy with military vehicles, which is attacked by Resistance fighters. Most of the captives appear to escape. Francesco reconnects with Luigi. Together they go to the priest, who has offered to hide them in a monastery.\nAfterwards the pair go to an inn where Marina lives and works to spend the night in hiding. When Luigi sees how she lives and finds her drugs they quarrel over her choices. Seeking revenge for his rebuke, she betrays both him and Francesco to the Nazis. The next morning Luigi, Francesco, Don Pietro, and an Austrian deserter the priest is also aiding, leave for the monastery. Francesco lags slightly behind, and is able to escape when the rest of the party is ambushed by Germans, who mistakenly believe the Austrian is him. Marina is rewarded by Ingrid with a fur coat and more drugs.\nAt Nazi headquarters Bergmann tells Ingrid of his plan - to extract everything from his captives before dawn in order to take the Resistance by surprise before news of their capture can get back to it.  He then offers leniency to Luigi in return for betrayal. Luigi refuses and is taken off to be tortured. The Austrian, who has already displayed cowardice at the prospect of interrogation, hangs himself in his cell. The Gestapo assault Luigi in waves with whips and a blow torch, in vain.\nObsessed with meeting the deadline he has set himself, Bergmann next tries to convince Don Pietro to use his influence on Luigi to betray his cause, describing Luigi as an atheist and communist who is an enemy of the Church. Don Pietro placidly responds that anyone who strives to live a righteous life is doing God's work. Bergmann then forces Don Pietro to watch Luigi's torture. When Luigi dies without revealing anything, Don Pietro blesses his body and commends him to God's mercy. Luigi's refusal to yield shakes the confidence of the Germans, including Bergmann, who had boasted that they were the \"master race\", and no one from a \"slave race\" could withstand their torture.\nMarina and a German officer who had bad-mouthed the Reich to Bergmann earlier in the officers' club stumble drunk into Bergmann's office with the door opened to the adjoining torture cell. When she sees that Luigi has refused Bergmann's deal and allowed himself to be tortured to death, she faints. The Gestapo chief and Ingrid decide that she is now useless to them and order her locked up. Ingrid removes the coat Marina had draped over her shoulders, saying she'll use it again on the \"next one\".\nIn the morning Don Pietro is taken to be executed. The parish altar boys-resistance fighters show up and begin whistling their signal tune to him. Effectively sightless since his glasses were broken being thrown roughly into a cell upon arrival at Nazi headquarters, Don Pietro is heartened when he recognizes the boys' tribute. An Italian firing squad readies to shoot, but most aim slightly off, unwilling to kill a priest. They fire. Seeing the merely wounded Don Pietro still mumbling prayers the presiding German officer, the same man who while drunk had decried the futility of the Nazi obsession with world dominance the night before to Major Bergmann, draws his pistol and puts the priest to a merciful end, muttering disdainfully over his involvement as part of the \"Master Race\".\nThe boys bow their heads in grief and slowly depart, the city of Rome and the dome of St. Peter's Basilica visible in the background.",
