  "plot": "Animated cartoon characters, or \"toons\", reside in a specialized area of Los Angeles known as Toontown, but regularly interact with humans to make films and do business. Private detective Eddie Valiant once worked closely with toons alongside his brother Teddy, but sank into depression and alcoholism after an unknown toon murdered Teddy.\nIn 1947, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his toon stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Eddie to investigate rumors about Roger's gorgeous toon wife Jessica having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at a nightclub, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica cheated.\nThe next morning, Acme is found murdered, and circumstantial evidence implicates Roger. While investigating, Eddie meets Judge Doom, Toontown's sinister superior court judge, who uses a chemical substance known as \"The Dip\", capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons (demonstrating it with a defenseless sentient clown shoe). Eddie later runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman. Herman suggests that Acme's missing will, which supposedly gives Toontown's ownership to the toons, may be what the killer really wanted.\nRoger appears in Eddie's office, insists that he has been framed, and begs for help. Eddie reluctantly takes Roger to his friend Dolores, who lets Roger hide in the bar she tends. Jessica approaches Eddie and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme.\nDoom and his weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Eddie tells Roger about Teddy's murder. As they leave with Dolores, Eddie sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf Industries, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's Pacific Electric transit system shortly before Acme's murder. \nEddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon. Roger stands guard outside, but is kidnapped by Jessica. Maroon tells Eddie that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio, then admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons. Maroon is then murdered by an unseen assailant before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene; assuming she is the culprit, he follows her into Toontown. When confronted, Jessica reveals that it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Earlier, Acme had given Jessica his will for safekeeping, but when she examined it, the paper was blank.\nJessica and Eddie are captured by Doom and the weasels. Back at the Acme factory, Doom reveals himself as the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf Industries, and explains his plot to destroy Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine. He then plans to route the new freeway through Toontown's land; with the Pacific Electric system decommissioned, people will be forced to use the freeway and Doom will net the profits. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's sprayer nozzle. Eddie performs a comedic vaudeville act full of pratfalls, causing several weasels to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the machine's dip vat, killing him. Eddie then fights Doom, who is flattened by a steamroller but survives, revealing himself as a disguised toon; specifically, the one who killed Teddy. Eddie empties the machine's supply onto the factory floor, spraying it all over Doom and melting him to death.\nThe emptied machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a train. As the police and many dozens of toons gather at the scene, Eddie reveals Doom as Acme's murderer to everyone, clearing Roger's name. Eddie also discovers that Roger inadvertently wrote a love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in disappearing/reappearing ink, and Toontown's ownership is handed over to the toons. Having regained his sense of humor, Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores, Roger, Jessica, and many other toons.",
