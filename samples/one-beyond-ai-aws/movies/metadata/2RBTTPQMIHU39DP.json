  "plot": "The Huns, led by the ruthless Shan Yu, invade imperial China by breaching the Great Wall. The Emperor orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the Imperial Chinese Army. Fa Mulan, an adventurous and active young woman, hopes to bring honor to her family. She is sent to a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. However, after multiple mishaps, the matchmaker deems Mulan a disgrace to the family.\nMulan's elderly father Fa Zhou - the only man in their family and a disabled army veteran - is conscripted. Mulan tries to dissuade him from going, but he protests that he must do his duty. Fearing for his life, she cuts her hair and takes her father's sword and armor, disguising herself as a man so that she can enlist in his stead. Quickly learning of her departure, Mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors for Mulan's safety. \nIn the local temple, Mushu, a small red dragon, is a disgraced former family guardian who is demoted to the role of awakening the spirits of the ancestors for failing to protect a family member. The Great Ancestor decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide Mulan. He sends Mushu to wake the guardian, but Mushu accidentally destroys the guardian's statue instead after it fails to awaken. With no other options, Mushu decides to aid Mulan himself.\nReporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named \"Fa Ping\", with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits\u2014including three named Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po\u2014gradually become trained soldiers.\nThe Emperor's belligerent councilor, Chi-Fu, threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang's men to fight. Mushu then crafts a fake letter from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The recruits set out and arrive at a burnt village, discovering that the Huns have massacred General Li and his troops. As the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the Huns. Mulan cleverly uses a Huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche; Shan Yu wounds her, but he and his army are buried. Mulan's deception is revealed when her wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang, having been saved by Mulan during the battle, spares her life and expels her from the army. Mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the Imperial City to report the Huns' defeat. However, Shan Yu and five of his warriors have survived, and Mulan sees them heading towards the Forbidden City.\nMulan enters the city and warns Shang, who does not believe her. The Huns then capture the Emperor and seize the palace. Mulan, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po dress up as concubines to distract the Hun guards, allowing Shang to stop Shan Yu from attacking the Emperor. Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she pins him there with his own sword. Mushu fires a large skyrocket, which strikes and propels Shan Yu into a fireworks launching tower, causing it to explode. The Emperor praises Mulan for her heroics and bows to honor her, prompting everyone else to do the same. Mulan declines his offer of a seat on the Royal Council, but accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts.\nMulan returns home and presents her gifts to her father, but he ignores them, happy to have her back; having become enamored with Mulan, Shang also arrives, and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian as the ancestors celebrate.",
