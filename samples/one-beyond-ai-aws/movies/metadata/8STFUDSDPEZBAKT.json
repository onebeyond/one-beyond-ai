  "plot": "Cha Tae-sik is a quiet man running a pawnshop, who has a friend named So-mi, a little girl from the same neighborhood. So-mi's mother Hyo-jeong is a go-go dancer and opium addict. Instructed by her lover, Hyo-jeong steals a large pack of opium being sold at the bar where she works and hides it in a camera bag, which she pawns to Tae-sik for safe keeping. Hyo-jeong's action attracts the attention of a drug lord named Oh Myung-gyu, who tasks his subordinate brothers Man-seok and Jong-seok to retrieve the opium. Jong-seok locates Hyo-jeong, where he tortures her in front of So-mi and forces her to reveal about the location of the drugs. Jong-seok's lackeys Du-chi and Bear go to Tae-sik's place to intimidate him, but he easily overpowers them. \nHolding So-mi hostage, Jong-seok forces Tae-sik to deliver opium to Oh Myung-gyu. Man-seok informs the police, leading to them trying to arrest Myung-gyu, who escapes. Tae-sik is arrested after discovering Hyo-jeong's body with her organs harvested in the back of the car he used to make the delivery. Tae-sik escapes from the police station,  alarming them with his display of combat skills. Upon further investigation, the police officers discover he was a former covert operative for the South Korean Army Intelligence, with numerous commendations, but retired after a hitman killed his pregnant wife and wounded him. The brothers tracked down Hyo-jeong's lover and kills him, while the brothers' bodyguard Ramrowan finds and kills Myung-gyu, allowing the two brothers to take over his operations. \nFollowing the lead from the burner phone received from Jong-seok, Tae-sik tracks Du-chi to a nightclub. As Tae-sik asks about the brothers. Ramrowan walks in and shoots at them, killing Du-chi and wounding Tae-sik. Bleeding out, Tae-sik escapes and finds his former partner, who nurses him back to health and helps him acquire a gun. Tae-sik goes back to the city and discovers a drug manufacturing plant, where he destroys the plant and frees the enslaved children forced to work there, killing Jong-seok in the process. Tae-sik confronts Man-seok's gang at his condominium. Claiming he has So-mi's eyes harvested, Man-seok shows Tae-sik a container with two preserved eyeballs. \nEnraged, Tae-sik kills the gang members, including Ramrowan and Man-seok. As Tae-sik prepares to commit suicide out of grief, a dirty but unscathed So-mi finds him. Ramrowan, who took pity on her because she had been kind to him, had spared her life - the eyes in the container belonged to the gangsters' surgeon. The police allow Tae-sik and So-mi to ride together after Tae-sik's arrest. While So-mi sleeps, Tae-sik asks them to drop at a small convenience store where he buys a backpack along with other school supplies. Tae-sik tells So-mi that she is going to be on her own as the police have to take him away. Before leaving, Tae-sik asks her for a hug and breaks down in tears as they embrace.",
