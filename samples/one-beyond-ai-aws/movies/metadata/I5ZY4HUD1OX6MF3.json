  "plot": "Young Texan Joe Buck quits his dishwashing job and heads by bus to New York City in cowboy attire to become a male prostitute. Initially unsuccessful, he finally beds a middle-aged woman, Cass, in her Park Avenue apartment. She is insulted when he requests payment, and Joe ultimately gives her money.\nJoe meets Rico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, an indigent con man with a limp who takes $20 for introducing him to a pimp. Upon discovering that the alleged pimp is actually an unhinged religious fanatic, Joe flees and unsuccessfully searches for Rico. Joe spends his days wandering the city listening to his Zenith portable radio and sitting in his hotel room. When his money runs out, management locks Joe out and impounds his belongings.\nJoe receives oral sex from a meek young man in a movie theater in an attempt to make money, but the man cannot pay. Joe threatens him, but releases him unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Rico at a diner and angrily confronts him. Rico manages to calm Joe and invites him to share his squalid, condemned apartment squat. Joe reluctantly accepts, and the two begin a \"business relationship\" as hustlers. Rico asks Joe to call him \"Rico\" instead of \"Ratso\", but Joe does not oblige. They struggle with severe poverty, stealing food and failing to get Joe work. Joe pawns his radio, while Rico's persistent cough worsens during winter without heat.\nIn intermittent flashbacks, Joe's grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He has a tragic relationship with Annie, disclosed through hazy flashbacks in which they are attacked and raped by a cowboy gang. Annie shows signs of mental trauma and is taken into an ambulance.\nRico tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoeshiner whose job yielded a bad back and lung damage from inhaling shoe polish. Rico learned shoe-shining from his father but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it. When he breaks into a stand and shines Joe's cowboy boots to attract clients, two police officers arrive and sit with their dirty boots next to Joe's. Rico dreams of escaping to Miami, shown in fantasies in which he and Joe frolic on a beach and are pampered at a resort, including a boy polishing Rico's boots.\nA Warhol-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his photograph and inviting him to a Warhol-esque art event. Joe and Rico attend, but Rico's poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention. After mistaking a joint for a cigarette and receiving uppers, Joe hallucinates. He leaves with Shirley, a socialite who pays him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play Scribbage and the resulting word play leads Shirley to suggest that Joe might be gay; suddenly he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joe's client and his career appears to be progressing.\nWhen Joe returns to the apartment, Rico is severely feverish. He refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe attempts to pick up an effeminate middle-aged man in an arcade. The two return to the man's hotel room where Joe demands money. When he refuses, Joe beats the man, robbing and apparently smothering him. Joe buys two bus tickets to Florida with the stolen money. Rico again tells Joe that he wants to be called \"Rico\", not \"Ratso\", and Joe finally begins to oblige. During the bus trip, Rico's health worsens and he suffers from urinary incontinence. \nJoe buys new clothing for Rico and himself at a rest stop, discarding his cowboy outfit. Back on the bus, Joe muses that there must be an easier way to make money than hustling and tells Rico he will get a regular job in Florida. When he does not respond, Joe realizes that Rico has died. The driver asks Joe to close Rico's eyelids, saying they must continue to Miami. The other passengers stare. Teary-eyed, Joe sits with his arm around his dead friend as the bus drives on past rows of Floridian palm trees.",
