  "plot": "While Philadelphia-based child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is home with his wife, Anna, Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated, breaks into their house. He accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.\nMonths later, Malcolm begins working with Cole Sear, a 9-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold and is suffering from depression. Cole's mother worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in there, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who walk around like the living do, unaware that they are dead.\nMalcolm thinks Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent is supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business.\nOne night, Cole discovers a female child ghost vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, the girl gives Cole a videotape that he hands to her father. The tape reveals the girl's mother poisoning her food, alerting her father to the reality of her death and saving her younger sister from the same fate.\nNow that Cole is doing better socially and personally, it marks the end of his sessions with Malcolm. Before parting ways, he suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep to ensure he can express his feelings. While stuck in traffic, Cole tells his mother his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her his late grandmother visits him and describes details from Lynn's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Cole's mother finally accepts that her son has a special ability.\nMalcolm returns home to find Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her, much to his confusion. When she drops his wedding ring, he notices that he is not wearing it like he thought he was. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm, in a twist ending, realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He, too, has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm tells Anna that he loves her and things will get better. Now that he has helped Cole and made amends with Anna, his business is complete and his spirit departs.",
