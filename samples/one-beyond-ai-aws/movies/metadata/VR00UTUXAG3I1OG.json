  "plot": "In Tokyo, college student Hana falls in love with an enigmatic man, who eventually reveals himself to be a werewolf. They later have two children, a daughter named Yuki and a son named Ame. Soon after Ame is born, their father is killed in an accident while hunting for food.\nHana's life as a single mother is difficult; she has to hide the children as they constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, and they often get into fights. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social workers concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and befriends some of the locals.\nOne day, Ame almost drowns in a river while trying to hunt a kingfisher. Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to enroll her in a public school, and Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school while Ame is bullied by his school peers. Meanwhile, Ame often skips school and becomes more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.\nIn fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, S\u014dhei, who realizes something is unusual about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets increasingly angry, leading her to transform into a wolf and inadvertently injuring his ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, S\u014dhei claims a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame, and the two become friends.\nYuki tries to encourage Ame to begin attending school, which he refuses. They argue over whether they should attempt to adapt to human society or embrace their nature as wolves. Two years later, Yuki's school is let out early due to treacherous weather. As Hana is about to leave to retrieve her, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, and Hana follows him. Yuki and S\u014dhei are left alone at school. Yuki reveals her ability to S\u014dhei and confesses that it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.\nWhile searching for Ame, Hana slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father telling her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see him fully transform into an adult wolf and run off into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.\nOne year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame's wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud of the way she raised them.",
