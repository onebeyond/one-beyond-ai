  "plot": "In Washington state in 1964, Selma Je\u017ekov\u00e1, a Czech immigrant, has moved to the United States with her 12-year-old son, Gene Je\u017eek. They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of local police officer Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is romantically pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff, who also works at the factory.\nSelma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but still is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of The Sound of Music and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her.\nIn her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical (\"Cvalda\"). Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma's vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda's excessive spending has put the couple's house in danger of foreclosure by their bank. He has contemplated suicide but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill quietly stays without knowing that Selma still sees him and watches her hide her money in a tin.\nThe next day, Selma's boss Norman believes that her eye condition is deteriorated, resulted for her to resign and gives a last salary for her in order to give her job back when her eyes cured, which Kathy accused him of firing her. Not willing to take her job back, Jeff tries to escort her home by car, but she takes home with a train (\"I've Seen It All\"). She adds her last wages to the tin but discovers it to be empty. Realizing that Bill has robbed her, she goes to his house to confront him. Linda accuses Selma of trying to seduce her husband, explaining that Bill told her Selma wanted him for his money. Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma.\nBill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him, telling her it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with a safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She slips into a trance and imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and slow dances with her (\"Smith & Wesson\"). Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene's operation in advance.\nNot knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested (\"In the Musicals, Part 1\"). In court, she is accused of being a Communist sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. When her claim of sending all her money to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and sentenced to death (\"In the Musicals, Part 2\"). Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face execution by hanging rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death (\"107 Steps\"). As Selma begins to become distraught, she is secured to a board. Kathy runs in to tell her that the operation was successful, and that Gene will see to his grandfather, and gives Selma her son's glasses.  Relieved, Selma sings a final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment. The trap door opens, and she is hanged before she can finish the last verse, whose lines are displayed as the proceedings conclude (\"New World\").",
