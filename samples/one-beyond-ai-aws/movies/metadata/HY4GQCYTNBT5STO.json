  "plot": "In June 1974, judiciary agent Benjamin Esp\u00f3sito investigates the rape and murder of Liliana Colotto de Morales. Esp\u00f3sito promises her husband, Ricardo, he will find the killer and give him a life sentence. Esp\u00f3sito is helped by his alcoholic partner Pablo Sand\u00f3val and the new department chief Irene Men\u00e9ndez-Hastings. Romano, Esp\u00f3sito's rival, accuses a pair of construction workers (one of whom is a Bolivian immigrant) of the murder, which angers Esp\u00f3sito upon discovering that both of them were tortured to obtain a confession.\nEsp\u00f3sito finds a lead while looking at old photos of Liliana, which Ricardo gave him: many of them featured a man, identified as Isidoro G\u00f3mez, staring at her obsessively. Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val sneak into G\u00f3mez's mother's house in Chivilcoy. During the break-in, they find some letters from G\u00f3mez to his mother. Sand\u00f3val steals them and Esp\u00f3sito finds out after returning to Buenos Aires. Their \"visit\" only causes them trouble with their higher-ups, and they are unable to find any evidence in the letters. G\u00f3mez is still on the loose due to a careless phone call from Ricardo to G\u00f3mez's mother, in a desperate quest for his wife's killer. Ultimately, the case is closed.\nIn 1975, Esp\u00f3sito finds Ricardo in a train station in Retiro and discovers that he was trying to find G\u00f3mez in multiple stations. Esp\u00f3sito convinces Men\u00e9ndez to reopen the investigation. Meanwhile, while getting drunk in a bar, Sand\u00f3val makes a discovery: an acquaintance of his identifies several names on the letters \u2013 seemingly without any connection \u2013 as footballers of Racing Football Club. After identifying him as a Racing fan, Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val attend a game between Racing and Hurac\u00e1n, in hopes of finding G\u00f3mez.\nWhile keeping an eye on the game's attendees in Hurac\u00e1n's stadium, Esp\u00f3sito and Sand\u00f3val locate G\u00f3mez among the crowd, but a sudden goal causes a hubbub and allows G\u00f3mez to flee. A chase ensues and G\u00f3mez is caught by the stadium's security guards as he invades the pitch. Esp\u00f3sito and Men\u00e9ndez then grill him illegally, and Men\u00e9ndez makes G\u00f3mez confess by calling him physically weak, and attacking his masculinity. G\u00f3mez is tried and sentenced, but Romano bails him out one month later in order to get revenge on Esp\u00f3sito and hires him as a hitman for the right-wing faction of the Peronist Party. Esp\u00f3sito and Men\u00e9ndez try to reverse it but are stopped by Romano's intervention. Esp\u00f3sito informs Morales that his wife's killer will never go to prison.\nWeeks later, Sand\u00f3val gets in a bar fight, causing Esp\u00f3sito to take him to his flat and fetch his wife. They find the door pried open, his pictures flipped over and Sand\u00f3val shot dead in his room. Esp\u00f3sito soon concludes that G\u00f3mez/Romano sent assassins after him, but Sand\u00f3val impersonated him to protect his friend. Fearing for his life, Esp\u00f3sito goes into hiding for 10 years in Jujuy Province with Men\u00e9ndez's cousins. Esp\u00f3sito returns to Buenos Aires in 1985 to find G\u00f3mez missing and Men\u00e9ndez married with two children.\nIn 1999, Esp\u00f3sito tries to make sense out of the case and visits Ricardo, who moved in 1975 to an isolated cottage in a rural area of the Buenos Aires Province. Ricardo loses control when Esp\u00f3sito asks him how he coped with his wife's death and the unfair end of the investigation since G\u00f3mez was never seen again after becoming part of Isabel Per\u00f3n\u2019s security detail. Ricardo tells Esp\u00f3sito that he kidnapped and murdered G\u00f3mez years earlier, and Esp\u00f3sito leaves. Moments later, however, he remembers Ricardo not wanting an easy death for G\u00f3mez decades ago, and Esp\u00f3sito sneaks back to Ricardo\u2019s house, where he finds Ricardo giving food to G\u00f3mez, whom he has kept imprisoned for 25 years in complete isolation, without ever talking to him. G\u00f3mez begs Esp\u00f3sito for human contact. Ricardo tells Esp\u00f3sito he promised him \"a life sentence\" as he staggers out.\nBack in Buenos Aires, Esp\u00f3sito visits Sand\u00f3val's grave for the first time. He then goes to Irene's office, ready to confess his love to her, something she was always expecting. Smiling, she tells him to close the door.",
