  "plot": "Ad\u00e8le is an introverted 15-year-old high-school student. She passes an older woman with short blue hair in the streets one day and is instantly attracted. She sleeps with Thomas, a boy from school, but is ultimately dissatisfied and ends their relationship. After having vivid fantasies about the blue-haired woman while masturbating and kissing B\u00e9atrice, one of her female friends, Ad\u00e8le becomes troubled about her sexual identity. B\u00e9atrice says she does not want to proceed further and tells Ad\u00e8le to forget the kiss.\nAd\u00e8le's friend, the openly gay Valentin, takes her to a gay dance bar. Ad\u00e8le later leaves and enters a lesbian bar, where some women flirt with her. The blue-haired woman, art student Emma, is there and intervenes, claiming Ad\u00e8le is her cousin. Emma and Ad\u00e8le become friends. After Emma shows up at the school, Ad\u00e8le's friends suspect her of being a lesbian and ostracise her.\nAd\u00e8le and Emma grow closer and kiss at a picnic. They later have sex and begin a passionate relationship. Emma's artsy family welcomes Ad\u00e8le, but Ad\u00e8le tells her conservative, working-class parents that Emma is her tutor for philosophy class. Some of Ad\u00e8le's old friends attend her surprise 18th birthday party, but Emma does not.\nIn the years that follow, the two women move in together. Ad\u00e8le becomes an elementary school teacher, while Emma tries to advance her painting career by throwing frequent house parties. At one party, Ad\u00e8le meets Emma's pregnant colleague Lise, gallery owner Joachim, and aspiring actor Samir. Samir discusses America with Ad\u00e8le while the others discuss sex, and the two become friends. Emma spends more time at the party with Lise.\nEmma belittles Ad\u00e8le's career but encourages her to pursue writing, while Ad\u00e8le insists she is happy the way she is. Their relationship grows tense as it becomes clear they have little in common. Emma comes home late, having spent the evening working with Lise. Out of loneliness, Ad\u00e8le sleeps with a male colleague. Emma discovers the cheating and furiously breaks up with Ad\u00e8le.\nThree years later, the two meet at a restaurant. Ad\u00e8le is happy with her job as a kindergarten teacher but has not moved on: she is still deeply in love with Emma. Emma is in a committed partnership with Lise and helps raise Lise's three-year-old daughter. Emma and Ad\u00e8le kiss, but Emma withdraws, although she admits she does not feel sexually fulfilled. She tells Ad\u00e8le that she no longer loves her, but that their relationship was special and she will always have \"infinite tenderness\" for her. The two part with apologies and tears.\nAd\u00e8le attends Emma's art exhibition. On one wall is a nude portrait of Ad\u00e8le that Emma painted during their time together. Emma acknowledges Ad\u00e8le but is focused on Lise and the other guests. Ad\u00e8le congratulates Emma on her success and, after a brief conversation with Samir, leaves. He chases after her but goes in the wrong direction, while Ad\u00e8le walks off into the distance.",
