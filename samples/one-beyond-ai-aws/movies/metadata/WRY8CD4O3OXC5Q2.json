During his graduation party, he is urged to join a business dealing in plastics\u2014the material of the future. Benjamin cringes as his parents are fulsome in their praise of him during the party and retreats to his bedroom until Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. He initially resists her advances, but his failed attempts to connect with his parents make him feel isolated. Desperate for any kind of connection, he soon invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym \"Mr. Gladstone\".\nBenjamin spends the summer floating in his parents' swimming pool by day and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that her loveless marriage resulted when she accidentally became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it. However, Benjamin's parents and Mr. Robinson, unaware of the affair, are eager for Benjamin to date Elaine and relentlessly pester him to ask her out. Benjamin gives in and reluctantly takes Elaine on a date.\nWhen Benjamin sees how upset Mrs. Robinson is, he attempts to sabotage the date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly, and taking her to a strip club. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin, feeling remorseful, runs out after her, apologizes, and kisses her. They eat at a drive-in restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair with a married woman. Benjamin swears that the affair is over and makes plans for another date with Elaine for the following day.\nTo prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin reveals to Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she orders Benjamin to leave. Soon, she returns to school at Berkeley. Benjamin follows her to Berkeley hoping to regain her affections. Elaine initially rejects him and briefly dates medical student Carl Smith, but then learns that her mother lied to her when she claimed that Benjamin raped her, and the pair reconcile. Benjamin pushes for an early marriage, but Elaine is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Later, an angry Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and confronts Benjamin in his boardinghouse room, where he informs him that he and his wife will be divorcing soon, and threatens to have Benjamin jailed if he continues to see Elaine. He then forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl.\nBenjamin drives back to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home, searching for Elaine. Instead, he finds Mrs. Robinson who calls the police and claims that her house is being burglarized. She then tells Benjamin that he cannot prevent Elaine's marriage to Carl. Before the police arrive, Benjamin flees the Robinson home and drives back to Berkeley. There, he visits Carl's fraternity and is told that the wedding will take place in Santa Barbara that day. He speeds to Santa Barbara in his Alfa Romeo  which he received as a graduation present from his parents. The car runs out of gas a short distance from the church. Benjamin runs to the church, arriving just as the ceremony is ending. Benjamin's desperate appearance in the glass church gallery stirs Elaine into defying her mother and fleeing the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large cross, which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping everyone inside. Benjamin and Elaine, still in her wedding gown, escape aboard a bus and sit among the startled and staring passengers. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly fade away as they begin to ponder their uncertain future.",
