  "plot": "Thousands of years ago, Apokoliptian warlord Darkseid and his Parademons attempted to take over the Earth using the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. Darkseid was foiled by a unified alliance of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and extraterrestrial beings. The Mother Boxes were then separated and hidden in different locations. In the present, the death of Superman at the hands of Doomsday triggers the Boxes' reactivation, attracting Steppenwolf, Darkseid's disgraced lieutenant. Steppenwolf aims to regain Darkseid's favor by gathering the boxes to form \"The Unity\", which would terraform Earth into a copy of their homeworld.\nSteppenwolf reaches Themyscira through a portal and fights the Amazons to obtain their Mother Box. Diana Prince informs Bruce Wayne, as the two are seeking to form a team of metahumans to protect the planet. After failing to recruit Arthur Curry, Bruce locates Barry Allen, who enthusiastically joins. Diana locates the cyborg Victor Stone, who joins after his father, Silas, and other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Parademons seeking the Mother Box hidden by the humans. Steppenwolf kills Atlantean guards and takes their Mother Box, forcing Arthur to join the group as well.\nVictor retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden. He reveals that it was used to rebuild his body after a car accident, explaining that the Boxes can rearrange matter. The group realizes they could resurrect Superman using the box. Meanwhile, Steppenwolf receives a vision of the Anti-Life Equation on Earth, a secret power sought by Darkseid to control all of existence.\nThe team exhumes Clark Kent's body and places it in the amniotic fluid of the genesis chamber in a Kryptonian ship. An amnesiac Clark is resurrected, attacking the group after perceiving them as a threat. Lois Lane calms him down and he regains his memories at his family home in Smallville. Steppenwolf retrieves the last Mother Box, but Victor's father sacrifices himself to supercharge it with laser heat, allowing Victor to track it. Without Superman, the five heroes travel to an abandoned Russian city called Pozharnov, where Steppenwolf aims to form the Unity.\nThey fight their way through the Parademons, with Superman arriving in time to subdue Steppenwolf. Victor fails to prevent the Unity, however, and the planet begins to break apart. Barry enters the Speed Force, reversing time and giving Victor the necessary charge that allows him and Superman to prevent the Unity. Working together, the team kills Steppenwolf. Darkseid vows to return to Earth to find the Anti-Life Equation.\nIn the epilogue, Bruce and Diana make plans to set up a headquarters for the team at the desolated Wayne Manor. Clark resumes his double life in Metropolis. Arthur meets with Vulko and Mera before going to see his father, and Barry informs his erroneously-convicted father in prison that he has acquired a job in Central City's police department. Victor is inspired by a message left by his father to realize his purpose in life.\nMeanwhile, Lex Luthor has escaped from Arkham Asylum and is visited by Slade Wilson, to whom he reveals Batman's secret identity. In an additional scene before the credits, Bruce awakes from an apocalyptic dream of the future and receives a visit from the Martian Manhunter, who promises to help prepare for Darkseid's return.",
