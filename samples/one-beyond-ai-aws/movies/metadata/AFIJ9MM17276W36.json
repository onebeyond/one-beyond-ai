  "plot": "A school-bus driver named Jang Kyung-chul encounters a woman named Jang Joo-yun and offers to fix her flat tire. After beating her unconscious and bringing her to his home, Kyung-chul methodically dismembers her, unaware of her ring dropping and getting stuck in the drain. Kyung-chul scatters the body parts into a local stream, where it is discovered, prompting the police to conduct a search led by Squad Chief Jang, Joo-yun's father. Her fianc\u00e9, Kim Soo-hyun, an NIS officer, vows to take revenge against the murderer.\nAfter learning of the four suspects from Jang, Soo-hyun privately interrogates two of them. Upon searching the home of Kyung-chul, the third suspect, Soo-hyun finds Joo-yun's ring. A short time later, Kyung-chul brings a schoolgirl home and assaults her. Soo-hyun beats him unconscious. Instead of killing Kyung-chul, Soo-hyun forces him to swallow a tracker, allowing him to track Kyung-chul's movements and listen to his conversations.\nWaking up, Kyung-chul is offered a ride by a taxi already containing one passenger. Noticing their ill intent, Kyung-chul attacks first. After murdering them, he throws out the bodies onto the side of the road. He drives to a clinic to have his wounds looked at. After being treated, he proceeds to sexually assault a nurse. Soo-hyun arrives, subdues him and slashes his Achilles tendon before leaving. At this point, Soo-hyun's intention became clear: he wants to torture Kyung-chul for as long as possible.\nKyung-chul visits the home of his friend Tae-joo, a murderer and cannibal. After learning of the situation, Tae-joo remarks that his tormentor must be related to one of his victims. Kyung-chul deduces Soo-hyun's identity. Soo-hyun arrives and incapacitates both murderers along with Tae-joo's girlfriend Se-jung. The next day, Tae-joo and Se-jung, still unconscious, are arrested by the police and sent to the hospital.\nElsewhere, Soo-hyun and Kyung-chul receive treatment for their wounds, aided by Soo-hyun's trusted subordinate to evade the police. Kyung-chul wakes up and overhears Soo-hyun and the subordinate talking about the transmitter. After being released, Kyung-chul steals and uses laxatives to excrete the transmitter, then plants it on a driver at a truck stop. Soo-hyun enters Tae-joo's hospital room to question him, and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Squad Chief Jang and his other daughter Jang Se-yun. Enraged, Soo-hyun breaks Tae-joo's jaw.\nKyung-chul arrives at the house of Jang, brutally assaults him, then kills Jang Se-yun. He then attempts to avoid Soo-hyun's revenge by surrendering to the police. However, Soo-hyun kidnaps Kyung-chul right in front of the police's eyes. At Kyung-chul's house, Soo-hyun tortures him, places him under a makeshift guillotine, and leaves him holding a rope between his teeth to keep the blade from falling.\nThough he mocks Soo-hyun, Kyung-chul begins to panic when he learns that his son and elderly parents, whom he had abandoned some time ago, have arrived and are trying to visit him. As his family opens the door, it triggers another mechanism that drops the blade and beheads Kyung-chul in front of his family. Soo-hyun breaks down in tears as he walks away.",
