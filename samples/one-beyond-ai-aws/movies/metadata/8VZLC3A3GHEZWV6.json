  "plot": "At an archaeological excavation in northern Iraq, Catholic priest- archaeologist, Lankester Merrin, unearths a medallion of Saint Joseph as well as a statuette representing Pazuzu, an Assyrian demon. As he prepares to leave, he sees a large statue of Pazuzu and two dogs fighting.\nIn  Georgetown, Washington, D.C., actress Chris MacNeil stars in a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. MacNeil with her 12-year old daughter Regan, rents a well-appointed house with servants in Georgetown, DC. \nFather Damien Karras, a psychiatrist who counsels Georgetown University priests, visits his ailing mother in New York. He confides to a colleague that he feels unfit in his role, citing a crisis of faith. \nChris hears noises in the attic, and Regan attributes them to her imaginary friend, \"Captain Howdy\", whom she talks to via a ouija board. In a local church, a statue of Mary is found desecrated.\nChris hosts a party. Karras' friend Father Dyer explains Karras' role as counselor, mentioning that his mother died recently. Regan, now possessed, appears and urinates on the carpet. After Chris puts Regan to bed, her bed shakes violently. Dyer consoles Karras, and Karras expresses guilt at not having been with his mother when she died. Karras dreams of his mother, a Saint Joseph medallion and\u2014briefly\u2014a demonic face.\nRegan becomes violent. She is subjected to several medical tests, which find nothing physically wrong with her. During a house call, the possessed Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan. Dennings is found dead at the foot of an outdoor staircase beneath Regan's window. Homicide detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings' head was turned 180\u00b0 backwards.\nRegan's condition worsens as her body becomes covered with sores. A doctor mentions exorcism as a remote option, suggesting a possible psychological benefit. Kinderman visits Chris, explaining that the only plausible explanation for Dennings' death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman leaves, the possessed Regan stabs her genitals with a crucifix. To Chris's horror, the possessed Regan turns her head backwards and speaks in Dennings' voice. Regan is confined to her bedroom.\nChris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. Over two meetings, the possessed Regan claims to be the Devil himself, and projectile vomits into Karras's face while  speaking in tongues, and reacts violently when tap water is sprinkled on her, which Karras had claimed was holy water\u2014a point against genuine possession. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. Desperate, Chris confides that the possessed Regan killed Dennings. At night, Chris's assistant calls Karras to the house. They witness the words \"help me\" materialize on Regan's skin. Still ambivalent, Karras concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual while Karras assists. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.\nMerrin arrives at the house, warning Karras that the demon attacks psychologically. As the priests read from the Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. It focuses on Karras, verbally attacking his loss of faith and his guilt over his mother's death. The priests rest momentarily and Merrin, shaking, takes nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother. Showing weakness, Karras exclaims that the demon is not his mother. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead. Enraged, Karras beats the possessed Regan and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras' neck and begins to possess him, freeing Regan. Karras hurls himself out the window, tumbling down the stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras last rites.\nThe MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room.",
