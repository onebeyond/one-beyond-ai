  "plot": "An airship carrying Sheeta \u2013 an orphan girl abducted by government agent Muska \u2013 is attacked by Dola and her gang, seeking Sheeta's crystal necklace. Attempting to escape, Sheeta falls from the airship, but is saved by the magic of the now-glowing crystal, which lowers her slowly. She is caught by Pazu, who takes her to his home. The next morning, Pazu shows Sheeta a picture his father took of Laputa, a mythical flying island. Determined to clear his father's name, Pazu vows to find Laputa. However, they are found and pursued by Dola's gang as well as the army and Muska. They are attacked and fall into a mine shaft, but are saved again by the crystal, which lowers them deep into the pit. In the tunnels, they meet Uncle Pom, who shows them deposits of the glowing mineral Aetherium, the same material as Sheeta's crystal.\nSheeta reveals to Pazu that she has a secret name tying her to Laputa, proving the myth is real, but the two are captured by the army and imprisoned in a fortress. Muska shows Sheeta a dead robot that fell from the sky, bearing the same insignia on Sheeta's crystal, and reveals she is the heir to the Laputan throne. Muska releases Pazu under the condition that Sheeta guides the army to Laputa. Pazu returns home, but is captured by Dola's gang, who prepare to fly to the fortress and take the crystal. Pazu joins them to attempt to save Sheeta. In the fortress, Sheeta recites an ancient phrase her mother taught her and inadvertently activates the magic of the crystal, reanimating the robot. The robot protects Sheeta from the army and destroys the fortress with its weapons, but is shot by the military airship Goliath. In the chaos, Pazu and Dola fly in and rescue Sheeta. However, Sheeta's crystal is left behind, and Muska decides to use it to navigate to Laputa.\nSheeta and Pazu bargain with Dola to be taken aboard her airship, and begin to work with the crew. Having seen the crystal's directions, Sheeta helps Dola navigate to Laputa. In the middle of the night, Sheeta and Pazu keep watch from the crow's nest when Dola's airship is attacked by Goliath. Dola detaches the crow's nest, which also functions as a glider attached to the ship with a line. Pazu spots a massive cloud, wherein he believes his father saw Laputa. Dola attempts to steer into the cloud, but is halted by violent winds. Goliath destroys Dola's airship, severing the line connecting it to the glider. Sheeta and Pazu pass through the turbulent lightning storm.\nThey land safely on Laputa, which they find deserted but for some fauna and one peaceful robot. The castle is in ruins, and a giant tree now grows out of the top of the island. However, the army arrives and begins looting the castle, having taken Dola's gang captive. Muska and his accomplices betray the army, prevent them from communicating with Earth, and capture Sheeta to take into the bottom of the castle. Pazu frees Dola's gang from their bindings and pursues Muska. The bottom of the castle is the epicenter of Laputa's ancient knowledge and weapons, which Muska activates using Sheeta's crystal, revealing to her that he is also descended from the Laputan royal line. Muska demonstrates Laputa's power by causing a massive explosion over the ocean, before destroying Goliath and its crew. Horrified, Sheeta takes back the crystal and flees. She gives the crystal to Pazu through a gap in the wall, but is cornered by a pursuing Muska in Laputa's throne room.\nMuska threatens her life for the crystal, but Pazu appears and bargains for a brief truce. Sheeta teaches Pazu another ancient phrase, the spell of destruction, which they recite, causing Laputa to begin to collapse. The light of the spell blinds Muska, who falls to his death, while Sheeta and Pazu are protected by the giant tree's roots. While Laputa's bottom falls out, the rest of the castle \u2013 along with Dola's glider \u2013 is preserved by the giant tree, and the island begins to rise into space. Sheeta, Pazu, and Dola's gang are able to escape, and briefly reunite before flying away.",
