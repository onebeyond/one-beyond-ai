  "plot": "Lovers Florence Carala and Julien Tavernier make a plan to kill Florence's husband Simon, a wealthy French industrialist who is also Julien's boss. Staying late at the office one Saturday, Julien, an ex-Foreign Legion parachutist and veteran of the Indochinese and Algerian wars, uses a rope to climb up the outside of the building to Simon's office and shoots Simon with Simon's own gun, afterward arranging the room to make it look like a suicide. He then makes his way back to his office and leaves the building with a secretary and security guard, who are to be his alibis. When he gets into his convertible, he glances up and sees he left the rope hanging from the building. Leaving the engine running, he rushes back into the building and boards the elevator. As it ascends, the security guard switches off the power and locks up for the weekend, trapping Julien between floors.\nMoments later, Julien's car is stolen by Louis, a young small-time crook, and his girlfriend V\u00e9ronique, a flower shop assistant. Waiting for Julien at a nearby caf\u00e9, Florence sees the car go by, with V\u00e9ronique leaning out the window. Assuming Julien could not go through with their plan and has picked up V\u00e9ronique, she wanders the Paris streets despondently all night, searching for him in local bars and clubs.\nLouis puts on Julien's coat and pockets Julien's revolver, which V\u00e9ronique finds in the glovebox. They drive back and forth on the highway for hours, until some Germans in a sporty Mercedes challenge Louis to a race. He follows them to a motel just off the highway, and the German driver, the jovial Horst Bencker, invites Louis and V\u00e9ronique to have a drink with him and his wife Frieda. Both couples check in and, while they chat, Frieda takes a few pictures of Louis and her husband with Julien's camera. She finishes the roll, so V\u00e9ronique drops the film off at the motel's photo lab.\nAfter the Benckers go to bed, Louis, worried because Horst had figured out he is not Julien Tavernier and annoyed because Horst had not taken him more seriously, attempts to steal the Mercedes, but Horst catches him and threatens him with a Cigar Tube held like a gun. Louis impulsively shoots and kills both Horst and Frieda with Julien's gun, firing until it is empty. He and V\u00e9ronique return to Paris in the Mercedes and hide in V\u00e9ronique's apartment. Convinced they will be caught and separated, V\u00e9ronique persuades Louis they should commit suicide, so they both swallow phenobarbital pills and go to sleep.\nBecause V\u00e9ronique registered at the motel using the names \"Mr. and Mrs. Julien Tavernier\" to avoid problems for Louis, who is wanted for petty crimes, and Julien's car, gun, and raincoat are found next to the Benckers' corpses, the police name Julien as the prime suspect. Officers go to search his office, escorted by the security guard, who eventually discovers Simon's body. Meanwhile, with the building's power back on, Julien finally escapes from the elevator. Unaware his picture is in the morning newspapers in connection to the Bencker case, he goes to the caf\u00e9 for some breakfast, but is quickly recognized, arrested, and charged with killing the Benckers, the police refusing to believe his alibi of being stuck in an elevator.\nFlorence, determined to clear Julien, gets V\u00e9ronique's address from the florist. She finds V\u00e9ronique and Louis drowsy, but alive, and calls the police with an anonymous tip. Louis reads the newspaper and thinks he has gotten away with murder, until V\u00e9ronique reminds him of the roll of film. He rushes to the motel's photo lab, tailed by Florence, but finds the pictures have already been developed, and he is arrested. Florence enters the lab, and the police show her the photographs of her and Julien that were on the roll, which make it clear they were secret lovers and give them a motive for killing her husband. Commissaire Cherrier says Florence will probably get a harsher sentence than Julien, but she, almost in a trance, replies that she did what she did for love and she and Julien will one day be reunited.",
