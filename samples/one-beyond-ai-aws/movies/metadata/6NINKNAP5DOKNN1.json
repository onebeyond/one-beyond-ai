  "plot": "Part one\nAgainst a backdrop of World War I, the 1917 Russian Revolution and ensuing civil war, the film uses a narrative framing device set later, involving NKVD Lieutenant General Yevgraf Zhivago's search for the daughter of his half-brother Dr Yuri Zhivago and Larissa (\"Lara\") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young worker, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and explains why.\n\nAfter his mother's burial, the orphaned child Yuri, who owns only an inherited balalaika, was taken by family friends Alexander and Anna Gromeko to Moscow. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor and a poet, becomes engaged to the Gromekos' daughter Tonya after her schooling in Paris.\n\nLara, 17 years old, is seduced by her mother's much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Komarovsky. Lara's friend, the idealistic Pasha Antipov, who wishes to marry her, is wounded by mounted police at a peaceful demonstration. Pasha's wound is treated by Lara, who hides a gun he picked up.\n\n\nTsarist Dragoons attack a peaceful demonstration\nLearning of Lara's relationship with Komarovsky, her mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. She refuses and he rapes her. A traumatised Lara later follows Komarovsky to a party; she shoots him in the arm, and is escorted out by Pasha. Pasha marries her, despite now knowing about her relationship with Komarovsky. They leave Moscow.\n\nDuring World War I Yuri, now married to Tonya, becomes a battlefield doctor. Pasha joins up, but is reported missing. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him and encounters Zhivago. For the next six months, they serve at a field hospital, as unrest grows in Russia after exiled Vladimir Lenin returns. Zhivago and Lara fall in love, but Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya.\n\nAfter Russia leaves the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Sasha and the widowed Alexander Gromeko in their Moscow house, which had been confiscated by the Soviet government and now houses many other people. Yevgraf, now a Cheka officer, tells Yuri that his poems have been condemned as anti-communist. Yevgraf provides documents so the family can travel to the Gromekos' country home, \"Varykino\", located in the Urals near Yuriatin. On a heavily guarded train they travel through contested territory where the Bolshevik commander Strelnikov is fighting anti-Communist White forces.\n\nPart two\n\nYevgraf (Alec Guinness, right) with Tanya (Rita Tushingham)\nThe train makes a stop close to Strelnikov's armoured train. Yuri gets out, is captured and taken to Strelnikov. Yuri recognises Strelnikov as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara is living in Yuriatin, now occupied by the Whites. Strelnikov allows Zhivago to return to his train. They find the main house at Varykino seized and sealed up by the Bolsheviks; the family settle into a cottage next door. In Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they begin an affair. When Tonya is about to give birth to a second child, Yuri breaks off with Lara but is then abducted by Communist partisans and forced to join them.\n\nAfter two years, Yuri deserts and returns to Yuriatin. Lara says that Tonya contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. Tonya later sent Lara a sealed letter for Yuri. Tonya had given birth to a daughter, and she, her father, and her two children are living in Paris following deportation.\n\nYuri and Lara become lovers again but Komarovsky arrives. Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers them help to leave Russia, but they refuse, instead going to Varykino, and hiding in the main house. Yuri begins the \"Lara\" poems, which will later bring him popular fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with troops. Recently appointed as an official in the Far Eastern Republic, he says that the Cheka only allowed Lara to remain in the area to lure Strelnikov; he had been captured five miles away, and committed suicide. They now intend to arrest Lara. Komarovsky's offer of safe passage is accepted, but once Lara is on her way, Yuri does not follow. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.\n\nYears later, Yevgraf finds a Moscow medical job for his now frail half-brother. Yuri sees Lara in the street. He has a fatal heart attack before reaching her. At Yuri's funeral Lara asks Yevgraf for help to find her daughter by Yuri, who was lost during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, in vain. Lara then disappears and Yevgraf believes she died in a labour camp.\n\nYevgraf believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter; she remains unconvinced. After being asked how she came to be lost, Tanya finally answers that her \"father\" (i.e. Komarovsky) had let go of her hand when they were running from the chaos of war. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider what Yevgraf says. Tanya's husband arrives, and she leaves with him. Yevgraf notices Tanya is carrying a balalaika. He asks if she can play it, to which her husband responds that she can and \"is an artist\".",
