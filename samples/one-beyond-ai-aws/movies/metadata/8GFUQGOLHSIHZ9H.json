  "plot": "Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is pulled from her regimen at the Academy in Quantico, Virginia, by her boss, Jack Crawford. He assigns her to interview the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer, on the pretense of persuading Lecter to answer a questionnaire about himself for the Bureau's psychological profiles, but secretly Crawford hopes to get insights into a psychopathic serial killer they call \"Buffalo Bill,\" who kills overweight young women and skins them.\nAt the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Frederick Chilton escorts Starling to Lecter's cell. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with the interview and rebuffs her, deducing Crawford's true motive and refusing to help. As she is leaving, another prisoner, Miggs, flings semen at her as he masturbates, angering Lecter, who calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his \"yourself.\" It's a clue that leads to a storage facility with a jar containing a man's severed head; Lecter says the man is linked to Buffalo Bill, and offers to profile the killer on the condition that he is transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Meanwhile, another waterlogged victim is found, with a death's head moth lodged in her throat.\nIn Tennessee, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of a U.S. senator. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them capture Buffalo Bill in time to rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues in exchange for personal information about herself; she tells Lecter about her father's murder when she was a child. Chilton eavesdrops on their conversation and exposes Starling's deceit to Lecter before offering him a new deal. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he meets Senator Martin, giving her accurate information on Buffalo Bill's appearance but falsely identifying him as \"Louis Friend.\"\nStarling figures out the name is an anagram of \"iron sulfide\", a.k.a. \"fool's gold\". She visits Lecter, now imprisoned in Tennessee, and requests the truth. He says all the information she needs is in the Buffalo Bill case file, then insists she recounts more of her past; she describes a traumatic childhood incident hearing spring lambs screaming at slaughter. Lecter speculates that she hopes that saving Catherine will end the recurring nightmares she has, and gains satisfaction from this shared revelation. Lecter returns the case files to Starling as Chilton has the police escort her out. Later that evening, Lecter kills his two guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears.\nStarling goes back over the case file, along with her notes from Lecter, and figures out that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim: Frederika Bimmel. Starling travels to Bimmel's Ohio hometown and discovers that she and Buffalo Bill were both tailors. In Bimmel's room, Starling finds dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from the victim and phones Crawford to tell him that Buffalo Bill is making a suit with human skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest; after cross-referencing Lecter's notes with hospital archives he found a man named Jame Gumb, who believes he is transsexual but was deemed too violent to apply for a sex-change operation. Crawford and an FBI Hostage Rescue Team storm Gumb's address in Illinois, finding the house empty. Meanwhile, Starling follows a lead from one of Bimmel's friends, which takes her to the house of one of their former clients. At the house, she meets \"Jack Gordon,\" but realizes he is Gumb after spotting a death's head moth flying loose. She pursues him, handgun drawn, into a cavernous basement and finds Catherine trapped in a dry well. In a dark room, Gumb stalks Starling with night-vision goggles, but reveals himself by cocking his revolver; she reacts quickly and shoots Gumb dead.\nAt the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is in the Bahamas at a Bimini airport. He assures her that he has no intention of pursuing her and requests that she return the favor, which she says she cannot. He subsequently hangs up the phone because he is \"having an old friend for dinner\". He trails a newly arrived Chilton into the crowd.",
