  "plot": "During the First World War, two French aviators of the Service A\u00e9ronautique, the aristocratic Captain de Bo\u00ebldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Mar\u00e9chal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German flying ace and aristocrat, Rittmeister von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army. Upon returning to the aerodrome, Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances\u2014a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Mar\u00e9chal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into \"La Marseillaise\". As a result of the disruption, Mar\u00e9chal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Mar\u00e9chal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.\nAt Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew who generously shares the food parcels he receives.  Bo\u00ebldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Bo\u00ebldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.\nRauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Bo\u00ebldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up.  Bo\u00ebldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but fatally hitting him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Bo\u00ebldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world.\nMar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Mar\u00e9chal down. They quarrel and part, but then Mar\u00e9chal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at Verdun, along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories\". She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Mar\u00e9chal fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Mar\u00e9chal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war.\nA German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but then their commanding officer orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.",
