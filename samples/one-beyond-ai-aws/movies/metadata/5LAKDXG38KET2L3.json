Bill and Abby pretend to be siblings to prevent gossip. The three are hired as part of a large group of seasonal workers by a rich, shy farmer. Bill overhears a doctor telling the farmer he has only a year to live, although the nature of the illness is not specified.\nWhen the farmer falls in love with Abby, Bill encourages her to marry him so they can inherit his money. They thus marry and Bill stays as her \"brother\". The farmer's foreman suspects the scheme. The farmer's health unexpectedly remains stable, foiling Bill's plans. Eventually, the farmer discovers Bill's true relationship with Abby; meanwhile, Abby has begun to fall in love with her husband. When a locust swarm and fires destroy his wheat fields, the incensed farmer chases Bill with a gun, but Bill kills him with a screwdriver, then flees with Abby and Linda.\nThe foreman and police pursue and eventually find them; Bill is shot and killed while running. Abby inherits the farmer's estate and leaves Linda at a boarding school. Abby leaves town on a train with soldiers departing for World War I. Linda runs away from school with a friend from the farm.",
