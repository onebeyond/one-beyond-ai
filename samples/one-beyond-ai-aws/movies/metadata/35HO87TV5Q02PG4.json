  "plot": "Seventeen-year-old Rohan is expelled from the Bishop Cotton boarding school in Shimla with three of his friends (Vikram, Benoy and Maninder) after they are caught watching a pornographic film outside campus in the middle of the night. Rohan returns home to Jamshedpur, where his stern, abusive, alcoholic father, Bhairav Singh, and his six-year-old half-brother Arjun (whom Rohan hadn't known before) live. Bhairav forces him to run every morning (racing him the last leg) and work at his metalworking factory and attend engineering classes at the local university. Bhairav expresses his disappointment in him by humiliating and abusing him, both verbally and physically. Rohan aspires to be a writer and his uncle, Jimmy, supports his ambition.\nRohan deliberately fails his examinations so that Bhairav will give up on him, freeing him to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. Bhairav, summoned to school to pick Arjun up, loses an important contract. Rohan comes home to find Arjun being rushed to the hospital for an unknown reason; according to Bhairav, Arjun fell down the stairs. Fearful of making things worse, Rohan lies to Bhairav that he passed his exams. Bhairav goes to Kolkata on an urgent business trip, leaving Rohan to look after Arjun in the hospital. Rohan impresses the hospital employees including doctors and nurses with his stories and poems, and discovers that Arjun was actually beaten by the angered Bhairav after he lost the contract.\nReturning from Kolkata, Bhairav learns that Rohan failed his exams. Enraged, he beats Rohan during the night and apologizes the following day. Announcing that he's going to remarry again, Bhairav decides to send Arjun to boarding school and have Rohan quit college to work full-time at the factory. When Jimmy offers to take Arjun in, Bhairav belittles him and throws him out of the house as Rohan begs Jimmy to take him away. Bhairav burns the diary in which Rohan has written all his poems, and later introduces his new wife and stepdaughter to him.\nRohan spends a night in jail after damaging Bhairav's car when Bhairav refuses to help him. He comes home to find his future stepmother and her relatives in the house, and learns that Arjun is leaving for boarding school the following day. Wishing Arjun luck, Rohan prepares to leave home. He has a bitter confrontation with Bhairav in front of his guests before punching him and running away. Bhairav chases Rohan through the streets on foot, but loses him. Rohan spends the night at Jimmy's house, and Jimmy speaks to him about Arjun. The next morning, Rohan returns home and finds Arjun waiting outside while Bhairav is gone to get an auto rickshaw to send him to the boarding school. Rohan convinces Arjun to go with him to Mumbai, where Rohan's friends from his school have asked him to move. Rohan leaves a watch (which Bhairav gave him on his 18th birthday) and a note warning that if he searches for them, he'll inform the police about his physically abusive nature and how he had abused both of them. Both brothers walk away and start their journey to Mumbai. Bhairav notices Arjun missing and picks up the note Rohan left him. With no choice, he decides to continue his part of life. Both brothers arrive at Mumbai.",
