  "plot": "Gelsomina, an apparently somewhat simple-minded, dreamy young woman, learns that her sister Rosa has died after going on the road with the strongman Zampan\u00f2. Now the man has returned a year later to ask her mother if Gelsomina will take Rosa's place. The impoverished mother, with other mouths to feed, accepts 10,000 lire, and her daughter tearfully departs the same day.\nZampan\u00f2 makes his living as an itinerant street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's na\u00efve and antic nature emerges, with Zampan\u00f2's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches her to play the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he intimidates her, forces himself upon her, and treats her cruelly at times. She develops a tenderness for him that is betrayed when he goes off with another woman one evening, leaving Gelsomina abandoned in the street. Yet here, as throughout the film, even in her wretchedness, she manages to find beauty and wonder, aided by some local children.\nFinally, she rebels and leaves, making her way into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto (\"The Fool\"), a talented high wire artist and clown. When Zampan\u00f2 finds her there, he forcibly takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After Il Matto drenches Zampan\u00f2 with a pail of water, Zampan\u00f2 chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed, and both men are fired from the travelling circus.\nBefore Zampan\u00f2's release from prison, Il Matto proposes to Gelsomina that there are alternatives to her servitude and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose \u2013 even a pebble, even she. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But when Gelsomina offers Zampan\u00f2 marriage, he brushes her off.\nOn an empty stretch of road, Zampan\u00f2 comes upon Il Matto fixing a flat tire. As Gelsomina watches in horror, the two men begin to fight; it ends after the strongman punches the clown on the head several times, causing the fool to hit his head on the corner of his car's roof. As Zampan\u00f2 walks back to his motorcycle with a warning for the man to watch his mouth in the future, Il Matto complains that his watch is broken, then stumbles into a field, collapses, and dies. Zampan\u00f2 hides the body and pushes the car off the road, where it bursts into flames.\nThe killing breaks Gelsomina's spirit and she becomes apathetic, constantly repeating, \"The Fool is hurt.\" Zampan\u00f2 makes a few small attempts to console her, but in vain. Fearful he will no longer be able to earn a living with Gelsomina, Zampan\u00f2 abandons her while she sleeps, leaving her some clothes, money, and his trumpet.\nSome years later, he overhears a woman singing the very tune Gelsomina often played. He learns that the woman's father had found Gelsomina on the beach and kindly taken her in. However, she had wasted away and died. Zampan\u00f2 gets drunk, gets in a fight with the locals, and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.",
