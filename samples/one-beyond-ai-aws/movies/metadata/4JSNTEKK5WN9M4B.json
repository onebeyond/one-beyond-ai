  "plot": "In the Valley of Peace, a land in Ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Po is a 19-year-old giant panda who helps his adoptive goose father named Mr. Ping, run their noodle restaurant. Po dreams of fighting alongside the Furious Five \u2013 Masters Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis \u2013 a group of kung fu masters who live in the Jade Palace, where they are trained by Master Shifu, a cranky red panda. One day, the wise tortoise Master Oogway predicts that Shifu's former snow leopard prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tai Lung, will escape from prison and attack the valley to obtain the Dragon Scroll, a legendary artifact he had previously been denied. Panicked, Shifu sends a goose named Zeng to increase the security at Chorh-Gom Prison in Mongolia, where Tai Lung is held.\nAt the same time, Shifu holds a tournament for the Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the prophesied hero worthy of reading the Scroll, which is said to grant limitless power to its reader. Po arrives too late to enter the arena; desperate to see his idols, he accidentally launches himself into the middle of the tournament off of a chair propelled by fireworks, Oogway proclaims Po the Dragon Warrior. Believing Oogway's decision to be an accident, a shocked Shifu tries to dispose of Po with a harsh training regimen, while the Five dismiss Po as an enthusiast with no potential in kung fu. Po considers quitting, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and gradually befriends Monkey, Crane, Mantis, and Viper with his resilience, culinary skill, and good humor.\nDuring this time, Po learns that Shifu's cold and distant behavior stems from his own shame over Tai Lung's betrayal, having raised him from infancy. At Chorh-Gom Prison, Zeng's warnings are ignored, and Tai Lung escapes. Shifu informs Oogway of the event, with the tortoise making Shifu promise to believe in Po as the Dragon Warrior. Oogway then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Shifu then informs Po and the Five of Tai Lung's escape, and tells Po he is the only one who can stop him. Feeling cheated, Tigress angrily attempts to explain to Shifu that he has been training the Five for many years to prepare for Tai Lung's escape, but Shifu tells her it is Po's destiny to stop Tai Lung. Upon hearing that Oogway has passed and that Tai Lung is approaching quickly, Po, still unable to make any progress with kung fu, attempts to run away, but Shifu stops him. Po then makes Shifu admit that he does not know how to train the panda into the Dragon Warrior. Tigress overhears this and leads the Five in a secret attempt to stop Tai Lung themselves.\nMeanwhile, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food, and successfully trains Po by incorporating these feats into an innovative kung fu style. The Furious Five fight Tai Lung; however, all but Crane are soon defeated by his nerve-strike technique. Crane carries Tigress, Viper, Monkey and Mantis back to the Jade Palace, where Shifu revives them and decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll. When Po reads it, he discovers that the scroll is nothing but a blank reflective surface. Despaired, Po and the Five evacuate the inhabitants of the Valley, while Shifu prepares to face Tai Lung alone. In trying to console a distraught Po, Mr. Ping reveals that his \"secret ingredient soup\" has no secret ingredient at all, explaining that things can become special with belief.\nRealizing that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll, Po rushes back to help Shifu. At the Jade Palace, Tai Lung overpowers Shifu and demands to know the location of the Scroll. Po arrives with the Dragon Scroll and challenges Tai Lung to combat. Po proves to be a formidable opponent, frustrating Tai Lung with his confusing fighting techniques. Tai Lung eventually wins, but also despairs over the blank scroll, and takes his anger out on Po. Discovering that his body fat renders him immune to Tai Lung's nerve strikes, Po trounces his adversary with his new kung fu style, and eventually defeating him using the Wuxi Finger Hold technique. Po is honored by the Valley and gains the respect of Tigress and the Furious Five.\nIn a post-credits scene, Shifu and Po share a meal while a peach that Shifu had planted earlier grows into a tree in the background.",
