  "plot": "During World War II, newly commissioned Ensign Willis Seward \"Willie\" Keith reports to the minesweeper USS Caine, commanded by Lieutenant Commander William De Vriess, also meeting the executive officer (XO), Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, and the communications officer, Lieutenant Thomas Keefer. De Vriess, popular with the men but disliked by Keith, is relieved by Lieutenant Commander Queeg. Keith is freshly out of college and officer candidate school and is courting May Wynn, who is not approved by his mother. Maryk is a career officer and Keefer is an aspiring novelist.\nQueeg attempts to instill strict discipline on the Caine's lax crew, which makes him unpopular with the officers and men.\nAfter a day of gunnery target towing, Queeg orders a turn to head back to Pearl Harbor, but distracts himself by berating Keith and Keefer over a crewman's appearance. Ignoring the helmsman's repeated warnings, he allows the Caine to turn in a full circle and cut the towline, setting the target adrift. Queeg tries to cover up the incident.\nDuring a shore leave, May breaks off her relationship with Keith after she asks him to essentially choose between her and his mother, and he makes the wrong choice. Keith returns to the ship for its next assignment. \n\nAssigned to escort a group of landing craft during an invasion of a small Pacific island, Queeg abandons his mission before he reaches the designated departure point, and instead orders the dropping of a yellow dye marker, leaving the landing craft to fend for themselves. Queeg asks his officers for their support, but they remain silent and nickname him \"Old Yellowstain\", which implies cowardice.\nKeefer, believing Queeg to be paranoid, encourages Maryk to consider relieving Queeg on the basis of mental incapacity under Article 184 of Navy Regulations. Though Maryk angrily rejects that possibility, he does begin keeping a medical log documenting the captain's behavior.\nWhen strawberries go missing from the officers' mess, Queeg convenes an elaborate investigation to determine the culprit. The investigation involves searching the ship and stripping all crew members. Convinced of Queeg's instability, Maryk asks Keefer and Keith to go with him to see Admiral Halsey about the matter. Arriving aboard Halsey's flagship, Keefer backs down and they return to the ship.\nAt the height of a typhoon, Maryk urges the captain to reverse course into the wind and take on ballast, but Queeg refuses. Maryk, supported by Keith, relieves Queeg of command under Article 184. The Caine returns to San Francisco, where Maryk and Keith face a court-martial for mutiny. Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a temporarily grounded Naval Aviator and an attorney before entering the Navy, becomes Maryk's defense counsel.\nAt the court-martial, Keefer claims he never observed any mental illness in Queeg and was \"flabbergasted\" when he was relieved. Under Greenwald's relentless cross-examination, Queeg exhibits odd behavior on the stand, and Maryk is acquitted.\nFollowing the acquittal, the officers of the Caine hold a party, where Keefer receives a frosty reception from Maryk. A drunken Greenwald arrives and berates all the officers for not appreciating Queeg's long service and failing to give him the support he asked for, instead deriding him as an incompetent, and claims their mistreatment of Queeg, who had been suffering from \"battle fatigue\" from his previous tour in the Atlantic, caused the captain to ultimately become indecisive during the typhoon. He denounces Keefer as the real \"author\" of the mutiny and throws a glass of champagne, the \"yellow wine\", in Keefer's face. The rest of the officers walk out, leaving Keefer alone in the room.\nKeith, now married to May Wynn, is promoted to lieutenant (junior grade), and assigned to a new destroyer commanded by now Commander De Vriess.",
