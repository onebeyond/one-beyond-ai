  "plot": "In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. An upset Oppenheimer leaves the demanding Blackett a poisoned apple, but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer should instead study theoretical physics at G\u00f6ttingen. He completes his PhD there and meets Isidor Isaac Rabi. The two later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He meets his future wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.\nIn December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be used to create a bomb. In 1942, amid World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. He assembles a scientific team including Rabi and Edward Teller in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi and David L. Hill. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere and destroys the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes that the chances of catastrophe are acceptably low. When Teller proposes constructing a hydrogen bomb and is swiftly rejected, he attempts to leave the Project but is convinced to stay by Oppenheimer.\nUpon Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance, while Oppenheimer believes it will end the ongoing war in the Pacific and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan's surrender. Oppenheimer, though praised by the public, is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and suggests restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amid the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly humiliating him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonate their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer previously denigrated him to Einstein in 1947.\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Special counsel Roger Robb harshly cross-examines Oppenheimer, fixates on his past communist ties, and negatively twists the testimony of Groves and other associates. Teller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback to Oppenheimer's 1947 conversation with Einstein reveals that Strauss was never mentioned, and Oppenheimer instead expressed his somber belief that he did indeed start a chain reaction that would destroy the world.",
