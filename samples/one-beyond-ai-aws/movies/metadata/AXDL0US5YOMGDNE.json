  "plot": "In the Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, a young woman named Imelda marries a man who eventually leaves her and her daughter Coco to pursue a music career. When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her family forever and starts a shoemaking business.\nMany years later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, Miguel, now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and his grandmother, who are also shoemakers. Despite his family's music ban, Miguel secretly idolizes the deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz, and teaches himself to play guitar by watching Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel inadvertently bumps into the family ofrenda, breaking a frame containing a photo of Imelda and an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather, whose head has been torn from the photo, holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Believing this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel tells his family he will become a musician. \nAfter Miguel's grandmother destroys his guitar, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes Ernesto's guitar to use in a local talent competition. Once Miguel strums it, he becomes invisible to all living people. However, he can interact with his skeletal dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel inadvertently removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel also discovers that stealing Ernesto's guitar caused him to be cursed; he must have a family blessing to return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will die. Imelda offers him a blessing on the condition he abandons music, but Miguel decides to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He encounters a homeless skeleton named H\u00e9ctor, who offers to help Miguel get to Ernesto, provided Miguel takes H\u00e9ctor's photo to the Land of the Living and puts it on an ofrenda. Otherwise, H\u00e9ctor will never get to visit his daughter, and will eventually disappear as one of the forgotten. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee again.\nMiguel sneaks into the mansion, where a surprised Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant. H\u00e9ctor arrives, again imploring Miguel to put up his photo. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor, who once performed together, begin to argue; Miguel learns that, when H\u00e9ctor wanted to break up the act and return home, Ernesto, who could not write songs himself, poisoned H\u00e9ctor and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes H\u00e9ctor's photo, and has Miguel and H\u00e9ctor thrown into a cenote pit. There, Miguel discovers that Coco's father, and Imelda's lost husband, is H\u00e9ctor, not Ernesto.\nRescued by his family, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, and Imelda's alebrije Pepita attacks Ernesto, causing a giant bell to fall on him. In the chaos, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's memory of H\u00e9ctor fades; Imelda and a fading H\u00e9ctor quickly bless Miguel, who returns home. \nAfter Miguel plays \"Remember Me\" on H\u00e9ctor's guitar, Coco brightens and sings along with him. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music.\nOne year later, Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in Ernesto's place. Miguel shows the family ofrenda to his new baby sister Socorro; the ofrenda now contains H\u00e9ctor and a recently-deceased Coco. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance, joining Coco and the rest of their family for a visit to the living. Miguel sings and plays for his relatives, both living and dead.",
