  "plot": "Nine years after meeting C\u00e9line in Vienna, Jesse has written a bestselling novel, This Time, based on their time together. During a book tour in Europe, he does a reading at Shakespeare and Company, where three journalists interview him: one is convinced the novel's characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. C\u00e9line also attends the reading.\nRequired to leave for the airport in an hour, Jesse and C\u00e9line use the time to roam Paris. Their conversations soon become deeply personal, and they passionately discuss work, politics and lament their failure to meet again in Vienna or exchange contact details. C\u00e9line informs she did not return as her grandmother died, and Jesse claims that he did not return either; after C\u00e9line asks him why he did not, he confesses that he did return.\nThey reveal how their lives have changed in the nine years apart: Jesse is married and has a son named Hank, while C\u00e9line has become an environmental activist and is in a relationship with a photojournalist. They each express dissatisfaction with their lives as they walk around Paris, and their old romantic feelings are slowly rekindled. Jesse says his novel was inspired by the hope of seeing C\u00e9line again, and she says that reading it caused painful memories.\nC\u00e9line and Jesse arrive at her apartment, even after continuous insistence that Jesse should not miss his flight. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar, which she wrote about their encounter in Vienna. Jesse plays Nina Simone's \"Just in Time\" on her stereo, which C\u00e9line dances to as he watches, the pair acknowledging he will miss his flight.",
