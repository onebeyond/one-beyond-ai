  "plot": "Chris Wilton, a recently retired Irish tennis professional, is taken on as an instructor at an upmarket club in London. He strikes up a friendship with wealthy pupil Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. \nTom's older sister Chloe is smitten with Chris, and they begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fianc\u00e9e Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of Nola, who is a struggling actress. This is a source of tension in the family. \nChloe persuades her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies. Alec does so, and Chris begins to be accepted into the family. As a result, marriage is discussed.\nOne afternoon, Nola's choice of profession is questioned by Eleanor, so she leaves the house in anger during a thunderstorm. Chris follows Nola outside and confesses his feelings for her, and they passionately have sex in a wheat field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident. Chris, however, wants an ongoing clandestine relationship. Chris and Chloe marry, while Tom ends his relationship with Nola.\nChloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance sometime later at Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. \nWhile Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, he asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying that she wants to raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges him to divorce his wife, he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his apartment and he just barely escapes public detection.\nSoon afterwards, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law's and brings it to his office in a tennis bag. After leaving the office, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news. He goes to her building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, whom he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. \nAs Nola returns, Chris shoots her in the stairwell. He then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was likely committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.\nDetective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview in relation to the murder. Before he goes in to see the detectives, he throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. \nThis imagery ties in to the opening scene when a tennis ball hits the net, but bounces back, and the narrator (Chris) says, \"The man who said, 'I'd rather be lucky than good,' saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.\"\nAt the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder. Chris appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.\nOne night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, had been committed for a \"grander scheme\", and that he is able to suppress his guilt. The same night, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders.\nThe next morning, however, Banner's theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who informs him that a drug addict found murdered on the streets had Mrs. Eastby's ring in his pocket. The detectives consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terence, and his uncle Tom blesses him not with greatness but with luck.",
