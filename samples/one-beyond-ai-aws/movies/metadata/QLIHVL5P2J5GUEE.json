  "plot": "In 1940, during the Battle of France, Allied soldiers retreat to Dunkirk encircled by enemy forces. Tommy, a young British private, flees the town when his comrades are killed by enemy fire. Rushing to the beach, he finds thousands awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who buries a body. After Luftwaffe dive bombers attack, they try to board a hospital ship by bringing a wounded man on a stretcher but are ordered off. They overhear Royal Navy Commander Bolton discussing the best way to rescue the men. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy saves a Highlanders regiment soldier, Alex. The three are sent to a destroyer, but it is hit by a torpedo before it can depart; Gibson saves Tommy and Alex as the ship sinks, and the three return to the beach. \nWith a single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep-draft ships, the Navy requisitions civilian vessels in England that can get to Dunkirk. In Weymouth, civilian sailor Dawson, with his son Peter, set out in his boat Moonstone, rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Their teenage hand George joins them on impulse. Crossing the English Channel, they save a shivering shell-shocked soldier from a ship wrecked by a U-boat. Realising that Dawson is going for Dunkirk, the soldier demands they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, George suffers a head injury that renders him blind. Three Royal Air Force Spitfires fly towards Dunkirk, to provide cover for the evacuation, limited to one hour of operation by their fuel supply. During a dogfight with enemy fighters, one of the pilots, Farrier, has his fuel gauge shattered. He and the other Spitfire pilot, Collins, determine that their leader has gone down and continue on. Moonstone watches the two RAF pilots protect a minesweeper from a bomber; Collins\u2019s Spitfire is hit by one of the escort fighters and he ditches. Although trapped in his canopy as the plane sinks, Collins is saved by Peter.\nTommy, Alex and Gibson join some soldiers of a Highlanders regiment to hide inside a beached trawler in the intertidal zone outside the Allied perimeter, waiting for the tide to rise. After its Dutch sailor returns, Germans start shooting at the boat for target practice, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has been silent, of being a German spy. Gibson reveals he is French; he took the identity of the dead British soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated. The group abandons the boat when it begins to sink, but Gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. Seeing a destroyer about to be attacked by a bomber, Farrier chooses to continue assisting the evacuation, despite realising that he will never make it back home to England. The destroyer is sunk by the bomber, and Moonstone manoeuvres to take aboard those in the water, including Alex, as the shell-shocked soldier starts helping. Peter finds George is dead, but when asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he says George will be fine. Farrier shoots the bomber down; its crash ignites the oil on the water, but Peter saves Tommy. Farrier reaches Dunkirk just as his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber about to attack the mole, and is cheered on by the troops. Landing his Spitfire beyond the perimeter, he burns the plane to prevent it falling into enemy hands and calmly awaits capture. Dawson evades gunfire from an enemy fighter, using a technique taught by his deceased elder son, a pilot lost at the start of the war.\nWith 300,000 men successfully evacuated, Commander Bolton stays to oversee the evacuation of the French. Arriving back in Weymouth, the shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away and exchanges a glance with Dawson, as Collins departs. Peter arranges for a local reporter to publish the story of George's role in the evacuation. Tommy and Alex board a train with fellow soldiers and receive cheers and gifts from the public when it arrives at Woking. Tommy reads Churchill's address, encouraging Britain to fight on.",
