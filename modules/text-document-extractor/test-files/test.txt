ASPIRIN ®
Page 3 of 48INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE
ASPIRIN ® (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is indicated for the relief of pain, fever and inflammation
of a variety of conditions such as influenza, common cold, low back and neck pain,
dysmenorrhea, headache, toothache, sprains and strains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis,
arthritis, bursitis, burns, injuries, following surgical and dental procedures.
ASPIRIN ® Extra Strength is also indicated for relief of migraine pain and the associated
symptoms of photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound), and
improves overall quality of life.
ASPIRIN ® is also indicated for the following uses, based on its platelet aggregation inhibitory
properties:
•
•
•
for reducing the risk of vascular mortality in patients with a
suspected acute myocardial infarction;
for reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in
individuals deemed to be at sufficient risk of such an event by
their physician.
- There is no evidence for a reduction in the risk of first
fatal myocardial infarction.
- ASPIRIN ® does not reduce the risk of either
cardiovascular mortality or first strokes, fatal or non-
fatal.
- The decrease in the risk of first non-fatal myocardial
infarction must be assessed against a much smaller but
not insignificant increase in the risk of haemorrhagic
stroke as well as gastrointestinal bleeding.
for reducing the risk of morbidity and death in patients with
unstable angina and in those with previous myocardial
infarction
• for reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and for
secondary prevention of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction;
• for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after total hip
replacement;

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
General
ASA is one of the most frequent causes of accidental poisonings in toddlers and infants. Tablets
should be kept well out of the reach of children.
ASA should be administered cautiously to patients with:
•
•
•
•
•
uncontrolled hypertension
impaired hepatic, renal function or cardiovascular circulation (e.g. renal vascular disease,
congestive heart failure, volume depletion, major surgery, sepsis or major haemorrhagic
events)
a history of bleeding tendencies, significant anemia and/or hypothrombinemia
concomitant treatment with anticoagulants (see “Drug Interactions”)
concomitant treatment with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen in patients on an
ASA regimen (see “Drug Interactions”)
Hypersensitivity
ASA may precipitate bronchospasm and induce asthma attacks or other hypersensitivity
reactions. Risk factors are present bronchial asthma, hay fever, nasal polyps, or chronic
respiratory disease. This applies also for patients showing allergic reactions (e.g. cutaneous
reactions, itching, urticaria) to other substances.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 5 of 48Hematologic
Due to effect on platelet aggregation, ASA may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
Caution is necessary when salicylates and anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently, as
salicylates can depress the concentration of prothrombin in the plasma.
Peri-Operative Considerations
Due to its inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation which persists for several days after
administration, ASA may lead to an increased bleeding tendency during and after surgical
operations (including minor surgeries, e.g. dental extractions).
Special Populations
Women attempting to conceive:
During the first and second trimester of pregnancy, acetylsalicylic acid containing drugs should
not be given unless clearly necessary. If acetylsalicylic acid containing drugs are used by a
woman attempting to conceive, or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, the dose
should be kept as low as possible and duration of treatment as short as possible.
Based on the limited published data available, the studies in humans showed no consistent effect
of acetylsalicylic acid on impairment of fertility and there is no conclusive evidence from animal
studies.
Pregnant Women:
Acetylsalicylic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may
adversely affect the pregnancy and/or the embryo/foetal development. Data from
epidemiological studies raise concern about an increased risk of miscarriage and of
malformations after the use of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor in early pregnancy. The risk is
believed to increase with dose and duration of therapy. Available data do not support any
association between intake of acetylsalicylic acid and an increased risk for miscarriage. For
acetylsalicylic acid the available epidemiological data regarding malformation are not consistent,
but an increased risk of gastroschisis could not be excluded. A prospective study with exposure
in early pregnancy (1 st -4 th month) of about 14,800 mother-child pairs has not yielded any
association with an elevated rate of malformations.
During the third trimester of pregnancy, all prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may expose
the foetus to:
cardiopulmonary toxicity (with premature closure of the ductus ateriosus and pulmonary
hypertension);
• renal dysfunction, which may progress to renal failure with oligo-hydroamniosis;
Use of any prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors at the end of pregnancy may expose the
mother and the child to:
• possible prolongation of bleeding time, an anti-aggregating effect which may occur even
after very low doses
• inhibition of uterine contractions resulting in delayed or prolonged labour
•
Consequently, acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 6 of 48Nursing Women:
ASA and its metabolites pass into breast milk in small quantities. Since no adverse effects on the
infant have been observed after occasional use, interruption of breast-feeding is usually
unnecessary. However, on regular use or on intake of high doses, breast feeding should be
discontinued early.
Pediatrics
A possible association between Reye's syndrome and the use of salicylates has been suggested
but not established. Reye's syndrome has also occurred in many patients not exposed to
salicylates. ASA should not be used in children and teenagers for viral infections with or
without fever without consulting a physician. In certain viral illnesses, especially influenza A,
influenza B and varicella, there is a risk of Reye’s syndrome, a very rare but possibly life-
threatening illness requiring immediate medical action. The risk may be increased when ASA is
given concomitantly; however, no causal relationship has been proven. Should persistent
vomiting occur with such diseases; this may be a sign of Reye’s syndrome.
Low Uric Acid Excretion:
At low doses, ASA reduces excretion of uric acid. This can trigger gout in patients who already
tend to have low uric acid excretion.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency:
In patient suffering from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, ASA may
induce hemolysis or haemolytic anemia. Factors that may increase the risk of haemolysis are
high dosage, fever, or acute infections.
Elderly
In general, ASA should be used with caution in elderly patients (≥ 60 years of age), as these
patients may be more susceptible to adverse reactions.
Monitoring and Laboratory Tests
Salicylates can produce changes in thyroid function tests.
Isolated cases of liver function disturbances (transaminases increase) have been described.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Many adverse reactions due to ASA ingestion are dose-related. The following is a list of adverse
reactions that have been reported in the literature and from both clinical and post-marketing
experience.
Gastrointestinal (the frequency and severity of these adverse effects are dose-related): nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or ulceration, dyspepsia, heartburn,
hematemesis, melena, abdominal pain, rarely gastrointestinal inflammation, and intestinal
diaphragm disease with frequency not known (especially in long-term treatment).
Bleeding: Due to platelet inhibition, bleedings e.g. perioperative haemorrhage, hematomas,
epistaxis, urogenital bleedings, and gingival bleedings may occur.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 7 of 48Serious bleedings, such as gastrointestinal tract hemorrhages, and cerebral hemorrhages are rare.
Isolated cases of potentially life threatening bleedings have been reported, especially in patients
with uncontrolled hypertension and/or concomitant antihemostatic agents.
Ear: dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss. Dizziness and tinnitus have been reported, which
may be indicative of an overdose.
Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, purpura, anemia. Anemia with respective
laboratory and clinical signs and symptoms, such as asthenia, pallor, and hypoperfusion is
generally caused by bleeding (e.g. occult microbleeding, acute or chronic bleeding). Hemolysis
and hemolytic anemia in patients with severe forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency has been reported.
Dermatologic and hypersensitivity: urticaria, pruritus, skin eruptions, asthma, anaphylaxis,
edema nasal congestion and rhinitus. Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock are
very rarely reported.
Miscellaneous: mental confusion, drowsiness, sweating, thirst. Transient hepatic impairment
with increase in liver transaminases has very rarely been reported. Renal impairment and acute
renal failure have been reported.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Overview
ASA should be used with caution with other products that have anticoagulation or antiplatelet
effects, as these effects may be potentiated. Drugs that bind to protein binding sites should also
be used cautiously since ASA may displace drugs from their protein binding site.
Contraindicated Interactions
Methotrexate, used at doses of 15mg/week or more: Increased hematological toxicity of
methotrexate (due to decreased renal clearance of methotrexate by anti-inflammatory agents in
general and displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding by salicylates). See
“Contraindications”.
Drug-Drug Interactions
Methotrexate, used at 15mg/week or less: Salicylates may retard the elimination of
methotrexate by decreasing renal clearance of methotrexate, displacing methotrexate from
protein binding sites, and thereby increasing its hematological toxicity.
Anti-coagulants, thrombolytics / other inhibitors of platelet aggregation / hemostasis, e.g.
warfarin, heparin: Caution is necessary when salicylates and anticoagulants, thrombolytics /
other inhibitors of platelet aggregation / hemostasis prescribed concurrently, as salicylates can
depress the concentration of prothrombin in the plasma, leading to an increased risk of bleeding.
Oral hypoglycemics, e.g. insulin, sulfonylureas: Large doses of salicylates have a hypoglycemic
action and may enhance the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents. Diabetics receiving concurrent
salicylate and hypoglycemic therapy should be monitored closely: reduction of the sulfonylurea
hypoglycemic drug dosage may be necessary.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 8 of 48Diuretics: Diuretics in combination with acetylsalicylic acid at higher doses leads to decreased
glomerular filtration via decreased prostaglandin synthesis. As a result, sodium excretion may be
decreased by salicylate administration.
Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates in large doses are uricosuric agents; smaller amounts may
depress uric acid clearance and thus decrease the uricosuric effects of other drugs.
Valproic Acid: Salicylates may alter valproic acid (VPA) metabolism and may displace VPA
from protein binding sites, possibly intensifying the effects of VPA. Caution is recommended
when VPA is administered concomitantly with salicylates.
Glucocorticoids (systemic), except hydrocortisone used as replacement therapy in
Addison’s disease: Decreased blood salicylate levels during corticosteroid treatment and risk of
salicylate overdose after this treatment is stopped via increased elimination of salicylates by
corticosteroids. Concurrent use may increase the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and
ulceration.
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: The hyponatremic and hypotensive
effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of ASA due to
its indirect effect on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway (i.e. inhibition of vasodilatory
prostaglandins leading to decreased glomerular filtration). The potential interaction may be
related to the dose of ASA (3g/day or more).
Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Increased risk of upper gastrointestinal
bleeding due to possibly synergistic effect.
Digoxin: Plasma concentrations of digoxin are increased due to a decrease in renal excretion.
NSAIDS:
ASA and other NSAIDs: The use of other NSAIDs with salicylates may increase the risk of
ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to a synergistic effect.
Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen can interfere with the anti-platelet effect of low dose ASA acid (81-325
mg per day). Long-term daily use of ibuprofen may render ASA less effective when used for
cardioprotection and stroke prevention. To minimize this interaction, regular users of ibuprofen
and of low-dose, immediate-release ASA should take the ibuprofen at least one hour after and 11
hours before the daily ASA dose. The use of delayed-release (e.g. enteric-coated) ASA is not
recommended when using ibuprofen regularly.
Naproxen: Naproxen may attenuate the irreversible platelet inhibition induced by
acetylsalicylic acid. Clinical pharmacodynamic data suggest that concurrent (same day) naproxen
sodium usage for more than one day consecutively inhibits the effect of low-dose acetylsalicylic
acid on platelet activity and this inhibition may persist for up to several days after stopping
naproxen sodium therapy. The clinical relevance of this interaction is not known. Treatment
with naproxen, in patients with increased cardiovascular risk may limit the cardiovascular
protection of acetylsalicylic acid (see “Special warnings and precautions for use”).
Healthcare professionals should advise consumers and patients regarding the appropriate
concomitant use of NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen or naproxen) and ASA.
Drug-Food Interactions
Interactions with food have not been established.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 9 of 48Drug-Herb Interactions
Interactions with herb have not been established.
Drug-Laboratory Interactions
Salicylates can produce changes in thyroid function tests.
Drug-Lifestyle Interactions
Alcohol: Increased damage to gastrointestinal mucosa and prolonged bleeding time due to
additive effects of acetylsalicylic acid and alcohol. Patients having 3 or more alcoholic drinks per
day should consult their physician before use.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
ASPIRIN tablets should preferably be taken after meals, with plenty of liquid.
Dosing Considerations
Please see below for specific dosing instructions for each indication.
Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment
Analgesic and antipyretic:
Adults: 1-2 tablets (325mg to 650mg) orally every 4 – 6 hours.
Children under 12: 10 to 15mg/kg every 6 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 2.4g
Consult a physician if fever lasts more than 3 days, pain lasts longer than 5 days, new symptoms
occur or redness/swelling is present.
Migraine pain and associated symptoms:
Adults: 1000mg (2 x 500mg tablets) at onset of pain or symptoms.
Children: Clinical studies to support migraine relief in children have not been conducted with
acetylsalicylic acid.
Anti-inflammatory:
Adults: 3 tablets (975mg) 4 to 6 times a day, up to 30 tablets daily, may be required for optimal
anti-inflammatory effect. A blood level between 15 and 30mg per 100 mL is in the desirable
therapeutic range.
Children: 60 to 125mg/kg daily in 4 to 6 divided doses.
Platelet aggregation inhibitor:
Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction:
An initial dose of at least 162mg chewed to ensure rapid absorption as soon as a myocardial
infarction is suspected. The same dose should be given as maintenance over the next 30 days.
After 30 days, consider further therapy based on dosage and administration for prevention of
recurrent MI (see Prior Myocardial Infarction).
ASPIRIN ®
Page 10 of 48Prevention of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction:
81 - 325mg once daily, according to the individual needs of the patient, as determined by the
physician.
Prior Myocardial Infarction or Unstable Angina Pectoris:
81 - 325mg daily according to the individual needs of the patient, as determined by the
physician.
Transient Ischemic Attack and Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic
Cerebral Infarction:
81 - 325mg daily according to the individual needs of the patient, as determined by the
physician.
Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism after total hip replacement:
162 - 325mg daily according to the individual needs of the patient, as determined by the

OVERDOSAGE
Mild Overdose or Early Poisoning - burning in the mouth, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus,
sweating, thirst, tachycardia or dizziness.
Moderate Overdose - all of the symptoms from mild overdose plus tachypnea, hyperpyrexia,
sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, restlessness, mental confusion.
Severe Overdose - all of the symptoms from moderate overdose plus hypotension, hallucinations,
stupor, hypoglycemia, convulsions, cerebral edema, oliguria, renal failure, cardiovascular failure,
coma, hemorrhage, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and/or failure.
Emergency Management:
1. Immediate transfer to hospital and maintain cardiovascular and respiratory support.
2. Gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal,
3. Check of acid-base balance and correct if necessary.
4. Alkaline diuresis so as to obtain urine pH between 7.5 and 8 should be considered when
plasma salicylate concentration is greater than 500mg/L (3.6 mmol/L) in adults or
300mg/L (2.2 mmol/L) in children
5. Hemodialysis should be considered in severe poisoning 800mg/L (5.8 mmol/L) in adults
and 700mg/L (5.0 mmol/L) in children, as renal elimination of salicylates may be slow
due to the presence of acidic urine and renal failure. Hemodialysis should also be
considered if the patient is experiencing severe systemic metabolic acidosis (arterial pH <
7.2), acute renal failure, pulmonary edema or CNS symptoms such as: drowsiness,
agitation, coma or convulsions.
6. Fluid losses should be replaced with hypotonic solution (e.g. half saline) and
supplemented with glucose 50 to 100g/L.
7. Symptomatic treatment.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 11 of 48Fatal Dose: varies from 10 to 30g of ASA. However, (in one case) 130g of ASA was ingested
without fatal outcome.
For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional Poison Control Centre.
ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Mechanism of Action
ASA interferes with the production of prostaglandins in various organs and tissues through
acetylation of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. Prostaglandins are themselves powerful irritants and
produce headaches and pain on injection in man. Prostaglandins also appear to sensitize pain
receptors to other noxious substances such as histamine and bradykinin. By preventing the
synthesis and release of prostaglandins in inflammation, ASA may avert the sensitization of pain
receptors.
The antipyretic activity of ASA is due to its ability to interfere with the production of
prostaglandin E 1 in the brain. Prostaglandin E 1 is one of the most powerful pyretic agents known.
The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA is due to its ability to interfere with the production
of thromboxane A 2 within the platelet. Thromboxane A 2 is, largely, responsible for the
aggregating properties of platelets.
In vitro studies have shown that ASA enhances the activity of the Nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP
system and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by acting on endothelial NO synthase site.
Pharmacokinetics
Absorption:
When ASA is taken orally, it is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine.
The gastric mucosa is permeable to the non-ionized form of acetylsalicylic acid, which passes
through the stomach wall by a passive diffusion process.
Optimum absorption of salicylate in the human stomach occurs in the pH range of 2.15 to 4.10.
Absorption in the small intestine occurs at a significantly faster rate than in the stomach. After
an oral dose of 0.65g ASA, the plasma acetylsalicylate concentration in man usually reaches a
level between 0.6 and 1.0mg % in 20 minutes after ingestion and drops to 0.2 mg % within an
hour. Within the same period of time, half or more of the ingested dose is hydrolyzed to salicylic
acid by esterases in the gastrointestinal mucosa and the liver, the total plasma salicylate
concentration reaching a peak between one or two hours after ingestion, averaging between 3
and 7mg %. Many factors influence the speed of absorption of ASA in a particular individual at
a given time; tablet disintegration, solubility, particle size, gastric emptying time, psychological
state, physical condition, nature and quantity of gastric contents, etc., all affect absorption.
Distribution:
Distribution of salicylate throughout most body fluids and tissues proceeds at a rapid rate after
absorption. Aside from the plasma itself, fluids which have been found to contain substantial
amounts of salicylate after oral ingestion include spinal, peritoneal and synovial fluids, saliva
and milk. Tissues containing high concentrations of the drug are the kidney, liver, heart and
lungs. Concentrations in the brain are usually low, and are minimal in feces, bile and sweat.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 12 of 48The drug readily crosses the placental barrier. At clinical concentrations, from 50% to 90% of
the salicylate is bound to plasma proteins especially albumin, while acetylsalicylic acid itself is
bound to only a very limited extent. However, ASA has the capacity of acetylating various
proteins, hormones, DNA, platelets and hemoglobin, which at least partly explains its wide-
ranging pharmacological actions.
Metabolism:
The liver appears to be the principal site for salicylate metabolism, although other tissues may
also be involved. The three chief metabolic products of ASA or salicylic acid are salicyluric
acid, the ether or phenolic glucuronide and the ester or acyl glucuronide. A small fraction is also
converted to gentisic acid and other hydroxybenzoic acids. The half-life of ASA in the
circulation is from 13 to 19 minutes so that the blood level drops quickly after absorption is
complete. However, the half-life of the salicylate ranges between 3.5 and 4.5 hours, which
means that 50% of the ingested dose leaves the circulation within that time.
Excretion:
Excretion of salicylates occurs principally via the kidney, through a combination of glomerular
filtration and tubular excretion, in the form of free salicylic acid, salicyluric acid, as well as
phenolic and acyl glucuronides. Salicylate can be detected in the urine shortly after its ingestion
but the full dose requires up to 48 hours for complete elimination. The rate of excretion of free
salicylate is extremely variable, reported recovery rates in human urine ranging from 10% to
85%, depending largely on urinary pH. In general, it can be stated that acid urine facilitates
reabsorption of salicylate by renal tubules, while alkaline urine promotes excretion of the drug.
With the administration of 325mg, elimination of ASA is linear following a first order kinetics.
At high concentrations, elimination half life increases.
Special Populations and Conditions:
Absorption and clearance of salicylates are not affected by gender or age.

DETAILED PHARMACOLOGY
Analgesia:
The analgesic effect of ASA has been recognized and utilized clinically for more than half a
century. The degree of analgesia attained with ASA is moderate but it has proved highly suitable
in the management of pathological pain of mild to moderate severity. As regards site of action,
both peripheral and CNS factors appear to contribute significantly to the pain relief afforded by
ASA. As for mechanism of action, the accumulated evidence of recent years indicates that ASA
acts by interfering with the synthesis and release of prostaglandins, thereby averting the
sensitization of pain receptors to mechanical stimulation or to other mediators.
Migraine:
Migraines are reoccurring headaches that last 4-72 hours and are characterized by lateralized
throbbing, moderate to severe pain intensity and at least one other of the following symptoms:
nausea, photophobia, phonophobia. Routine physical activity aggravates the symptoms. Some
individuals also experience neurological aura such as blurring of vision before the pain and
associated symptoms occur.
ASPIRIN ®
Page 19 of 48Evidence suggests that there are at least three mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of
migraines: extracranial arterial vasodilatation, extracranial neurogenic inflammation and
decrease inhibition of central pain transmission. It has been shown that the degree of
inflammatory activity is proportional to the intensity of the pain felt and as the blood pulses, the
characteristic throbbing emerges.
An estimated two million Canadians have been diagnosed with migraines but many migraineurs
never receive a clinical diagnosis; therefore, the actual numbers of Canadians who suffer from
migraines could be over 3 million. Over 70% of migraine suffers are women and the majority
are aged between 20 and 50 years. This prevalence is based in part due to hormonal fluctuations
that women experience related to menstruation, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, menopause
and hormone replacement therapy.
The use of a single dose of ASA (2 x 500 mg tablets) in patients with a migraine attack was
investigated in two placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted by Bayer. Treatment with ASA
resulted in a statistically significant relief of migraine pain and in the associated symptoms of
photophobia and phonophobia that continued throughout the 6 hour post-dose observation. The
results also showed a significant improvement in overall quality of life for migraine sufferers but
there was no difference between ASA and placebo groups in headache recurrence.
Antipyresis:
Interference with the synthesis and release of prostaglandins is also involved in the antipyretic
activity of ASA. ASA effects a significant reduction in elevated body temperature, but has little
effect on normal body temperature. This latter is maintained by a delicate balance between heat
production and heat loss, with the hypothalamus regulating the set point at which body
temperature is maintained. Fever is induced by synthesis and release of prostaglandins in this
temperature-regulating area and ASA acts by interfering with this process. Heat production is
not inhibited but dissipation of heat is augmented by increased peripheral blood flow and by
sweating.
Anti-inflammatory effect:
Components of the anti-inflammatory action of the salicylates are increased capillary resistance,
thus reducing capillary leakage in response to local toxins, interference with the production of
tissue-destructive lysosomal enzymes and inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin E
compounds which have been shown to be potent mediators of the inflammatory process. Besides
interfering with the synthesis of prostaglandins ASA also acts by interfering with lymphocyte
activation and lymphokine production. Lymphokines are produced by activated thymus
lymphocytes which are abundant in the inflammatory tissues of patients suffering from
rheumatoid arthritis. They cause increased vascular permeability and white blood cell
chemotaxis, activate macrophages and stimulate lymphocyte DNA synthesis. They also induce
release of tissue-destructive lysosomal enzymes as well as prostaglandins. The prostaglandins
themselves, beside causing many manifestations of inflammation also act as a potent negative
feedback mechanism by inhibiting lymphokine production. An indepth review of the effects of
ASA on the lymphocyte-macrophage axis in inflammation has been published.
Effects on platelets: relation to hemostasis and thrombosis.
Platelets play an important role in normal hemostasis and clinical pathologic and experimental
evidence indicates that their aggregation may play an equally important role in the evolution of a
ASPIRIN ®
Page 20 of 48variety of disease states including cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and
myocardial infarction. ASA inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly acetylating platelet
cyclo-oxygenase, thereby blocking the production of prostaglandin endoperoxides PGG 2 and
PGH 2 which are precursors of the major platelet-aggregating material, thromboxane A 2 , which is
also a powerful vasoconstrictor. However, ASA does not prevent the adherence of platelets to
damaged vessel walls or the release of granule contents from these adherent platelets. As the
anuclear platelets are unable to synthesize new enzyme molecules to replace those that have been
inactivated, inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA thus persists for the life of the platelets.
Daily administration of 20 to 40 mg of ASA to healthy volunteers reduced platelet thromboxane
production but inhibited platelet aggregation only partially. When administered to patients
recovering from myocardial infarction, 50 mg ASA daily had the same effects on thromboxane
production, platelet aggregation and bleeding times as 324 mg daily. Other studies show that
ASA doses of 40 to 325 mg daily suppressed thromboxane production by at least 80%, but 80
mg ASA daily was the lowest dose required for maximum cumulative thrombocyte function
inhibition. The protective effect of ASA against experimentally induced thrombosis or
atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in several animal models.
Besides inhibiting the biosynthesis of thromboxane A 2 by platelets, ASA also interferes with the
production of prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) by vascular endothelial cells, the above-mentioned
prostaglandin endoperoxides being common precursors of both thromboxane A 2 and
prostacyclin. This latter compound is one of the most powerfully acting platelet deaggregators
and vasodilators and thus it would appear that the interference with the hemostatic processes by
ASA depends on the thromboxane-prostacyclin balance. In fact, it has been suggested that under
some conditions, high doses of ASA may be thrombogenic. However, in contrast to platelets,
the vascular endothelial cells are able to regenerate cyclo-oxygenase in a relatively short time
and therefore therapeutic doses of ASA are likely to produce a lesser inhibition of the vascular
prostacyclin system than of the platelet thromboxane-forming mechanism. In fact, there is no
clinical evidence to indicate that high doses of ASA would result in an increased risk of
thromboembolism. Indeed, quite the contrary was observed and, in a controlled study,
paradoxical shortening of the bleeding time was not observed at a daily ASA dose of 3.6 g.
Lower dosages of ASA make selective blocking of the TxA 2 -synthesis without a simultaneous
blocking of PGI 2 -production possible.
The use of ASA in patients with a suspected acute myocardial infarction was investigated in a
large multi-centre trial involving over 17,000 patients. Treatment with ASA resulted in a 23%
reduction in the risk of vascular mortality versus placebo at 5 weeks. This use translates to a
reduction of 24 deaths and 14 non-vascular events per 1000 patients treated.
The effect of time to therapy revealed that patients treated with ASA “early” (0 to 4 hours)
versus “late” (5 to 24 hours) after symptom onset experienced reductions in the odds of vascular
death of 25% versus 21%, versus placebo at 5 weeks. ‘Early’ treatment with ASA resulted in
the saving of 4 additional lives per 1000 patients versus ‘late’ treatment.
Long term follow-up (up to 10 years) of patients in this study established that the early survival
advantage to ASA persisted long term, and that this prolonged benefit was additive to that of
fibrinolytic therapy.
The use of ASA for secondary prevention of thrombotic events is supported by a comprehensive
overview of a number of clinical trials involving patients who already had some type of vascular
ASPIRIN ®
Page 21 of 48disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke or transient cerebral ischemia). Overall,
these studies point to a 26-28 % reduction of the combined endpoints of MI, stroke, or vascular
deaths by treatment with ASA alone at doses of 75 to 325 mg daily. Studies which directly
compared low doses with higher doses (30-1200 mg/day), indicated that the incidence of
gastrointestinal adverse effects were significantly less common with the lower doses.
In a study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), patients given ASA at
a dosage of 80 mg to 650 mg within 48 hours of revascularization had a risk of dying reduced to
1.3% as compared to 4.0% for those who did not receive treatment (P<0.001). There was a
reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction of 2.8% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001. In total, the
reduction in fatal and non-fatal outcomes was lower in those who received ASA, 10.6% vs.
18.6% in those who did not (p<0.001). The investigators Perioperative Ischemia Research
Group (PIRG) concluded that early use of ASA after coronary by-pass surgery is safe and is
associated with a reduce risk of death and ischemic complications involving the heart, brain,
kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.
There was no ASA dose effect observed for either fatal or non-fatal outcomes with total doses
lower than 325mg daily.
Recent discussions have focused on the efficacy of ASA for the primary prevention of
myocardial infarction and stroke. Two large scale randomized trials, aimed at evaluating
prophylactic use of ASA, were conducted among apparently healthy male physicians (22,000 in
the United States and 5,000 in the United Kingdom) and their results have been published. In the
summary overview of the combined results presented by the principal investigators, the authors
state that:
“Taken together, these two primary prevention studies demonstrate a significant (p < 0.0001)
reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction of about one third.”
On the other hand, the same two studies have not indicated any reduction in overall vascular
mortality and also suggested a slight increase in the risk of non-fatal disabling stroke. Current
controversy exists about the applicability of these findings, obtained in a selected population, to
the general public. As well, the optimum dosage regimen still remains an open question in this
regard. Thus, the use of ASA for primary prevention should remain, in the words of the
principal investigators:
"a matter of judgment in which the physician considers the cardiovascular risk profile of the
patient and balances the known hazards of ASA...against the clearly established reduction in the
incidence of a first myocardial infarction".
Effect of Ibuprofen on Platelet Aggregation, Bleeding and Clotting Times in Normal
Volunteers.
Experimental data suggest that ibuprofen may inhibit the effect of low dose ASA (81-325 mg per
day) on platelet aggregation when they are dosed concomitantly. In one study, when a single
dose of ibuprofen 400mg was taken within 8 hours before or within 30 minutes after immediate
release ASA dosing (81mg), a decreased effect of acetylsalicylic acid on the formation of
thromboxane or platelet aggregation occurred. However, the limitations of these data and the
uncertainties regarding extrapolation of ex vivo data to the clinical situation imply that no firm
conclusions can be made for regular ibuprofen use, and no clinically relevant effect is considered
to be likely for occasional ibuprofen use. In a more recent double blind, randomized, placebo-
ASPIRIN ®
Page 22 of 48controlled trial with healthy subjects by Cryer et. al, 2005, it has been shown that the drug-drug
interaction is absent when immediate release ASA (81 mg) was taken 1 hour before taking
ibuprofen (400 mg, TID) and also when ibuprofen was given 11 hours before the intake of low
dose ASA. Thus, in order to adequately minimize potential interaction, the recommended dosing
schedule for immediate release low dose ASA is to wait at least 11 hours after or 1 hour before
taking up to a 400mg dose of ibuprofen.

TOXICOLOGY
The clinical and pathological signs of poisoning from toxic and lethal oral doses of ASA have
been extensively described for man, much less extensively for other species.
The acute toxicity of ASA in animals has been studied and reviewed in detail by Boyd. The
signs of poisoning in rats from doses in the lethal range are due to varying degrees of
gastroenteritis, hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, shock and minor toxic
effects on other organs and tissues. Death is due to convulsions or cardiovascular shock. The
major difference between species appears to be the ability to vomit toxic doses seen in man, cats
and dogs, but not in mice, rats and rabbits. Otherwise, the pathological reaction to toxic doses of
ASA is similar in all species in which such studies have been reported. The acute oral LD 50
values have been reported as being over 1.0 g/kg in man, cat and dog, 0.92 g/kg in female and
1.48 g/kg in male albino rats, 1.19 g/kg in guinea pig, 1.1 g/kg in mouse and 1.8 g/kg in rabbit.
Chronic toxicity studies were reported in mice and rats. When ASA was administered at 2 to 20
times the maximum tolerated clinical dose to mice for up to one year, a dose-related deleterious
effect was observed on mean survival time, number of young born and number of young raised
to weaning age. No evidence of carcinogenic effect was found.
The chronic oral LD 50 in male albino rats has been reported as 0.24 g/kg/day when given for 100
days. At these daily doses ASA produced no anorexia and no loss of body weight. It did
produce polydipsia, aciduria, diuresis, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, piloerection, rapid and deep
respiration, tachycardia, and during the second month, soft stools, epistaxis, sialorrhea,
dacryorrhea and death in hypothermic coma. Autopsy disclosed the presence of a hypertrophied
stomach, renal congestion, mild hepatitis and pneumonitis. While teratogenic effects were noted
in animals at near lethal doses, there is no evidence to indicate that ASA is teratogenic in man.

ABOUT THIS MEDICATION
What the medication is used for:
ASPIRIN 81mg, ASPIRN 81 mg Quick Chews and
ASPIRIN Regular Strength 325mg can help save your
life in the following situations to help prevent:
- a first heart attack in those who are at increased risk, or
- a second heart attack or stroke in those who have already
had such an event
ASPIRIN may help save your life if you think you are
having a heart attack.
FOR PREVENTION OF A FIRST NON-FATAL
HEART ATTACK (DAILY THERAPY):
Your doctor may recommend you take ASPIRIN 81mg,
ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews or ASPIRIN Regular
Strength 325mg to help reduce the risk of a first non-fatal
heart attack because you are at risk of having a heart attack.
There is no evidence that this product reduces the risk of a
first fatal heart attack, nor first strokes (fatal and non-fatal),
nor death due to any cardiovascular problems. Your doctor
will assess the appropriate balance of possible benefit of
this product against the potential risk of stomach bleeding
and stroke. Factors that increase your risk include high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, family history of
heart disease, increased age, overweight and smoking. You
should follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. Please
notify your doctor if you intend to stop taking this
medication.
USE DURING A HEART ATTACK
If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911
immediately then, chew and swallow two ASPIRIN 81mg
or ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews tablets or one ASPIRIN
325mg tablet. It is important to chew the product, to
ensure this medicine quickly works. Then get to a hospital
immediately for medical attention. Inform the emergency
services / hospital that you have taken ASPIRIN. Taking
ASPIRIN 81mg, ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews or
ASPIRIN Regular Strength 325mg at the first signs and
symptoms can reduce your risk of dying from the heart
attack.

The signs and symptoms of a heart attack include:
•
uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in
the centre of the chest that lasts more than a few
minutes, or goes away quickly and comes back,
•
pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck or arms,
•
chest discomfort with lightheadedness, fainting,
sweating, nausea or shortness of breath.
Chest pain is the most common symptom in both sexes, but
women may also experience other symptoms such as
unusual fatigue that gets worse with activity, difficulty of
breathing, heartburn/nausea and /or vomiting unrelieved by
antacids, tightening and pain in the chest that may extend
into the neck, jaws and shoulders, general feeling of

ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews or ASPIRIN Regular
Strength 325mg daily to help prevent a second heart attack
or stroke. After having experienced a first heart attack or
stroke, you can be at increased risk of experiencing a
second one. You may also be at risk for heart disease and
stroke because you may be overweight, a smoker, have an
inactive lifestyle, high blood pressure, are under stress or
have high blood cholesterol.
Following your doctor’s instructions concerning the use of
ASPIRIN 81mg, ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews or

acetaminophen, anticonvulsants, anti-diabetic/arthritis/gout
medicines, digoxin, glucocorticoids, methotrexate,
selective-serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (a type of
antidepressant), diuretics, ACE inhibitors (medication for
high blood pressure), or are having 3 or more alcoholic
drinks per day. NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen or naproxen) may
interfere with the heart protective benefits of ASPIRIN.
Patients should talk to their doctor if they are on an
ASPIRIN regimen and take NSAIDs for pain.
PROPER USE OF THIS MEDICATION
Usual dose:
DIRECTIONS (Adults ≥18 years): During a heart
attack: Call 911, then, chew 2 – ASPIRIN 81mg or
ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews tablets or 1 – ASPIRIN
Regular Strength 325mg tablet/caplet.
For prevention of a first heart attack or for the
prevention of a second heart attack or stroke: ASPIRIN
81mg or ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews – 1 to 4 tablets
daily, depending on your doctor’s instructions. ASPIRIN
Regular Strength 325mg– 1 tablet/caplet daily, depending
on your doctor’s instructions. You should take this
medicine at the same time every day. This will help you to
remember to take your medication. For maximum
effectiveness, it is very important to take ASPIRIN 81mg,
ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews or ASPIRIN Regular
Strength 325mg every day as directed by your doctor. Do
not take more tablets than your doctor recommends. Your
doctor may tell you to take ASPIRIN 81mg, ASPIRIN
81mg Quick Chews or ASPIRIN Regular Strength 325mg
with other medications; he or she may also tell you to eat
special foods, exercise or take other steps to safeguard your
health.
For daily therapy ASPIRIN 81mg, tablets should be
swallowed whole for the medicine to work properly.
ASPIRIN 81mg tablets have a special enteric coating,
which allows the tablets to pass undissolved through the
stomach and on into the intestine. By dissolving in the
intestine rather than the stomach, the risk of stomach upset
is reduced in those with a sensitive stomach. Therefore, to
maintain this protection, the tablets should not be crushed
or broken.
For daily therapy with ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews,
tablets could be chewed or swallowed whole.
For daily therapy with ASPIRIN Regular Strength 325mg,
tablets could be swallowed whole.
Can I Continue to Take ASPIRIN for Relief of
Headache, Fever or Arthritis Pain?
ASPIRIN 81mg or ASPIRIN 81mg Quick Chews is
specially designed to reduce your risk of dying during a
heart attack, to help prevent a first heart attack in those who
are at increased risk and to help prevent a second heart
attack or stroke. It is a smaller dose than you would need
to take for a headache or other types of pain and is unlike
other pain reliever products such as acetaminophen or
Page 39 of 48IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ
NSAIDs e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen. Ask your doctor or
pharmacist about other ASPIRIN products available (or
other pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen,
naproxen or salicylates) and the correct dosage for the
relief of your headache, fever or arthritic pain.
Always consult with your doctor or pharmacist before
taking other medications.

Do not use NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen or naproxen) if you are
taking ASPIRIN 81mg for preventive therapy without
talking to a doctor or pharmacist, as NSAIDs may interfere
with the preventive benefits of ASPIRIN 81mg.
PROPER USE OF THIS MEDICATION
Usual dose:
DIRECTIONS (Adults ≥ 18 years): For doctor
supervised long-term preventive therapy: 1 to 4 tablets
daily, depending on your doctor’s instructions. You should
take this medicine at the same time every day. This will
help you to remember to take your medication. For
maximum effectiveness, it is very important to take
ASPIRIN 81mg every day as directed by your doctor. Do
not take more tablets than your doctor recommends. Your
doctor may tell you to take ASPIRIN 81mg with other
medications; he or she may also tell you to eat special
foods, exercise or take other steps to safeguard your health.
ASPIRIN 81mg tablets have a special enteric coating,
which allows them to pass undissolved through the stomach
and into the intestine. By dissolving in the intestine rather
than the stomach, the risk of stomach upset is reduced.
Therefore, to maintain this protection, the tablets should not
be crushed or broken.
During a heart attack: Call 911, then, chew 2 tablets.
Can I Continue to Take ASPIRIN for Relief of
Headache, Fever or Arthritis Pain?
ASPIRIN 81mg is specially designed for doctor supervised
long-term preventive therapy. It is a smaller dose than you
would need to take for a headache or other types of pain
and is unlike other pain reliever products such as
acetaminophen or NSAIDs e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen. Ask
your doctor or pharmacist about other ASPIRIN products
available (or other pain relievers such as acetaminophen,
ibuprofen, naproxen or salicylates) and the correct dosage
for the relief of your headache, fever or arthritic pain.
Always consult with your doctor or pharmacist before
taking other medications.

In case of overdose call a doctor or poison control
centre immediately, even if there are no symptoms.
